What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2013","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.5","genres":["Action","Drama","Fantasy","Super Power","Mystery","Military"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/267440/hdtvlogo/attack-on-titan-51a64c2cb7247.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7442/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/267440/showbackground/attack-on-titan-551eb271053e8.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"LHtdKWJdif4","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/attack-on-titan"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"},{"name":"Mystery","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mystery"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"}]},{"id":"kitsu:1376","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Death Note","aliases":["Death Note","DN"],"description":"A shinigami, as a god of death, can kill any person—provided they see their victim's face and write their victim's name in a notebook called a Death Note.

With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2012-2013","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Action","Sci-Fi","Police","Psychological"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/262090/hdtvlogo/psycho-pass-51f83338cf2de.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7000/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/262090/showbackground/psycho-pass-53db3233c7256.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"70zW21l5ZUU","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/psycho-pass"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Police","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Police"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"}]},{"id":"kitsu:3128","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Soul Eater","aliases":["Soul Eater"],"description":"Death City is home to the famous Shibusen, a technical academy headed by the Shinigami–Lord Death himself.

Merging these events together are the kindhearted would-be thieves, Isaac and Miria, connecting various people, all of them with their own hidden ambitions and agendas, and creating lifelong bonds and consequences for everyone involved.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite] ","releaseInfo":"2007","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Action","Supernatural","Mystery","Comedy","Historical"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/80421/hdtvlogo/baccano-5ce761fd2c8bb.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/2039/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/80421/showbackground/baccano-629497ec7998f.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"W5bn87yvh_g","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/baccano"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Mystery","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mystery"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7258","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"High School DxD New","aliases":["High School DxD New","High School DxD Dai 2-ki","High School DxD 2nd Season","High School DxD Second Season","Highschool DxD 2"],"description":"The misadventures of Issei Hyoudou, high school pervert and aspiring Harem King, continue on in High School DxD New.

With several magicians looking to harm the girl, Kamijou will defend his new companion at all costs as he discovers a strange new realm of the supernatural.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2008-2009","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Action","Magic","Sci-Fi","Super Power"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/83322/hdtvlogo/a-certain-magical-index-5beeaca715775.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3725/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/83322/showbackground/a-certain-magical-index-5fcc8d6dd7f03.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/toaru-majutsu-no-index"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"}]},{"id":"kitsu:2684","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Spice and Wolf","aliases":["Spice and Wolf","Ookami to Koushinryou"],"description":"Holo is a powerful wolf deity who is celebrated and revered in the small town of Pasloe for blessing the annual harvest.

Together, they must set aside their differences and work together to find the power granting shards spread across feudal Japan and deal with the threats that arise.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2000-2004","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.6","genres":["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Demons","Fantasy","Magic","Romance","Supernatural"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/71361/hdtvlogo/inuyasha-52950369b2959.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/224/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/71361/showbackground/inuyasha-5295073a278af.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"n5f47FVUlrs","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.6","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/inuyasha"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Demons","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Demons"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"}]},{"id":"kitsu:43211","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Fumetsu no Anata e","aliases":["To Your Eternity","Fumetsu no Anata e","To You, the Immortal"],"description":"In the beginning, an \"orb\" is cast unto Earth. \"It\" can do two things: change into the form of the thing that stimulates \"it\"; and come back to life after death. \"It\" morphs from orb to rock, then to wolf, and finally to boy, but roams about like a newborn who knows nothing.

This event left him jaded to the notion of romance, seeing it as only a distraction that gets in the way of studying.\nUnfortunately for Eita, his efforts hit a snag when he receives a confession of love from Masuzu Natsukawa, a transfer student with platinum hair and blue eyes. Eita sees through the confession, causing Masuzu to admit that she only did so because having a boyfriend would stop people from asking her out daily. She finds love to be just as much of a hindrance as he does, so by pretending to date, they can stave off advances from everyone else.\nEita refuses on the grounds that his classmates will be jealous, but Masuzu blackmails him by revealing that she has his journal and will post it online for everyone to see if he betrays her. Thus begins Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru, a story that follows Eita coping with his new \"relationship\" and the complications that arise from it.","releaseInfo":"2013","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"6.9","genres":["Comedy","Romance","School","Harem"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/264052/hdtvlogo/oreshura-5cd7bbf86fcf9.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7162/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/264052/showbackground/oreshura-628b628d48f40.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"NV-fkpq_ZwQ","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"6.9","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/oreshura"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Harem","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Harem"}]},{"id":"kitsu:471","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Majo no Takkyuubin","aliases":["Kiki's Delivery Service","Majo no Takkyuubin","Witch's Express Delivery"],"description":"Kiki, a 13-year-old witch-in-training, must spend a year living on her own in a distant town in order to become a full-fledged witch.

Confused by this unexpected turn of events, the Hero refuses to ally himself with his enemy, claiming that the war the demons have waged is tearing the Southern Nations apart.\nHowever, the Demon Queen rebuts, arguing that the war has not only united humanity but has also brought them wealth and prosperity, providing evidence to support her claims.

For nine-year-old Ren, things could hardly be worse. His mother has passed away in a traffic accident, his father is nowhere to be found, and his extended family is cold and distant. Desperate, Ren runs away to the mean streets of Shibuya to try and survive on his own.\nIn the beast realm of Shibuten, the fierce warrior Kumatetsu is certainly feared, but not especially liked or respected. When the Lord decides to retire and become a God, Kumatetsu would be a natural candidate to replace him; he and the noble Lord Iouzan are the two strongest in the land. But Kumatetsu is so anti-social he's never even managed to hold on to a disciple. And until he proves he can, he'll never be a serious contender.\nWhen Ren gets lost in a maze of alleyways and finds himself in the strange land of Shibuten, fate brings these two stubborn and fierce-willed souls together, and Kumatestu re-names the boy \"Kyuuta.\" Each of them has much they can teach the other, but where these two are concerned, nothing is going to be easy. As Kyuuta adjusts to his new home he finds himself torn between two worlds—two worlds that are far less separate than either the Boy or the Beast realizes.","releaseInfo":"2015","runtime":"118 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Adventure","Supernatural","Family","Action"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/315465/hdmovielogo/the-boy-and-the-beast-bakemono-no-ko-5d2284e0a82ee.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10065/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/315465/moviebackground/the-boy-and-the-beast-bakemono-no-ko-5742e61baa5f6.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"PkNtujKPZtE","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/bakemono-no-ko"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Family","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Family"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"}]},{"id":"kitsu:42117","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Kyokou Suiri","aliases":["In/Spectre","Kyokou Suiri","Invented inference","Stranger Case"],"description":"When she was still just a girl, Kotoko was kidnapped by yokai.

Thus, Nishikata continues to strive for the seemingly impossible—to outsmart Takagi and make her blush with embarrassment.","releaseInfo":"2019","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/337936/hdtvlogo/karakai-jouzu-no-takagi-san-5c251164c3433.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/42110/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/337936/showbackground/teasing-master-takagi-san-61dc009d8953d.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"Z_iXQH8Bxog","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/karakai-jouzu-no-takagi-san-2"}]},{"id":"kitsu:3438","type":"series","animeType":"special","name":"Clannad: Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, Tomoyo-hen","aliases":["Clannad: Another World, Tomoyo Chapter","Clannad: Another World","Clannad: Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, Tomoyo-hen","Clannad OVA"],"description":"In an alternate universe to the original Clannad anime, Okazaki Tomoya is dating Sakagami Tomoyo in the 24th and final episode of Clannad.\nWhen Tomoyo is elected Student Council President, her dream to save the school's cherry blossom trees from being cut down begins to come to fruition.

Despite being Makoto's age, she couldn't be more different: Erio chooses to wrap herself in a futon all day rather than to go to school. She even claims to be an alien, and with a speech pattern and personality to back it up, any chance of Makoto's dreamt-of normal life is instantly tossed out the window.\nAs he meets a string of other eccentric girls in town, Makoto must face the possibility of seeing his youth points in the red. However, he might be surprised by how thrilling an abnormal youth can be.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2011","runtime":"1 min","imdbRating":"7.2","genres":["Comedy","Sci-Fi","Slice of Life"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/247934/hdtvlogo/denpa-onna-to-seishun-otoko-5c7e101f4e0ce.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5710/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/247934/showbackground/denpa-onna-to-seishun-otoko-60d327785d64a.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"kk0GQZbJP_I","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/denpa-onna-to-seishun-otoko"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"}]},{"id":"kitsu:727","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Legend of the Galactic Heroes","aliases":["Legend of the Galactic Heroes","Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu","LoGH","LotGH","Gin'eiden","GinEiDen","Heldensagen Vom Kosmosinsel"],"description":"For 150 years the galaxy has been locked in an interstellar war between the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance, fighting battles with thousands of spaceships and millions of soldiers on both sides. The crumbling Goldenbaum dynasty rules the Empire while the Alliance is in an increasingly dysfunctional democratic state.\n\nTwo new commanders enter the stage: Imperial Admiral Reinhard von Lohengramm and the FPA's Yang Wen-Li. Reinhard is a talented minor aristocrat given a high station—and a powerful grudge—after the Kaiser took his older sister as a concubine. Wen-Li originally joined the military only to fund his university education, but has become a brilliant though reluctant leader. Each begins to attract a circle of similarly gifted soldiers, generals and thinkers around him, and in time the rivalry between these two very different men will shatter the existing stalemate. As they deal with superiors and subordinates, maneuver through personal and political problems, plot strategies and fight battles, both will bend the course of events to their will and, in turn, be tested and changed by the greatest war in human history!\n\nLegend of the Galactic Heroes is a vast, sentimental and thoughtful military space opera.

When Haruko informs the basketball team's captain of Hanamichi's near-inhuman physical capabilities, he slowly finds himself drawn into the camaraderie and competition of the sport he had previously held resentment for.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"1993-1996","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":["Comedy","Drama","School","Sports"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/72491/hdtvlogo/slam-dunk-5c7e0be01a9b1.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/148/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/72491/showbackground/slam-dunk-58c4bdb4065f2.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/slam-dunk"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Sports","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sports"}]},{"id":"kitsu:45338","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Mob Psycho 100 III","aliases":["Mob Psycho 100 III","Mob Psycho 100 Season 3","Mob Psycho 3rd Season","モブサイコ100 Ⅲ"],"description":"The third season of Mob Psycho 100.","releaseInfo":"2022","runtime":null,"genres":[],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/45338/poster_image/medium-97a1ec91a4030560da0054caf868df96.jpeg","background":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/45338/cover_image/7b07f7425d4767a749acd7041d23189b.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"b1miJsAVYJA","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[]},{"id":"kitsu:5114","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Ookami-san to Shichinin no Nakama-tachi","aliases":["Okami-San and Her Seven Companions","Ookami-san to Shichinin no Nakama-tachi","Ookami-san to Shichinin no Nakamatachi","Okamisan and Seven Companions"],"description":"Ookami Ryouko is a spunky and, by some accounts, rather manly high school girl.

The Axis Powers feature the titular character North Italy, who is clumsy, carefree and loves pasta; Germany, who is very serious but easily flustered; and Japan, who is stoic but has bizarre interests.\nBased on Hidekaz Himaruya's widely popular webcomic turned print manga, Hetalia Axis Powers is a historical comedy that pokes lightly at culture, examines the relationships between nations and breathes fun into history.\n[Written By MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2009-2010","runtime":"5 min","imdbRating":"7.1","genres":["Comedy","Historical","Parody"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/88161/hdtvlogo/hetalia-axis-powers-5c812961b8ad6.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3910/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/88161/showbackground/hetalia-axis-powers-62c0200045161.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"byUpQQ9o9Yk","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/hetalia-axis-powers"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Parody","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Parody"}]},{"id":"kitsu:42892","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Princess Connect!

Amazed by Toua's unique prowess on the mound, veteran slugger Kojima Hiromichi artfully scouts the pitcher for his long unsuccessful team, the Saikyou Saitama Lycaons.

Rising to the challenge of swaying the owner, Toua suggests a one-of-a-kind \"One Outs\" contract: every out Toua pitches will earn him five million yen, but with every run he gives up, he will lose fifty million yen.\nAdapted from the manga by Shinobu Kaitani of Liar Game fame, One Outs documents the intense psychological battles between Toua and those around him.

(Hashire, Melos!), Natsume Soseki’s Kokoro, Ryunosuke Akutagawa’s Hell Screen (Jigoku Hen) &amp; The Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito), and Ango Sakaguchi's In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita).\n\nNo Longer Human (Ningen Shikkaku) - A high school student becomes lost and alienated. Despondent and aimless, he falls into a cycle of self abuse, depression and drugs that taints his life for years. Told in four chapters, each chapter deals with a different point in his life and the final chapter leaves him standing alone - an empty and hollow caricature of his former self.\n\nIn the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita) - A love story between a 12th-century woman and a mountain bandit who abducts her.\n\nKokoro - A 1914 tale of a young man's life journey during the Meiji era. The work deals with the transition from the Japanese Meiji society to the modern era, by exploring the friendship between a young man and an older man he calls \"Sensei\". It continues the theme of isolation developed in Soseki's previous works, here in the context of interwoven strands of egoism and guilt, as opposed to shame.\n\nRun, Melos! (Hashire, Melos!) - An updated retelling of a classic Greek tale of the story of Damon and Pythias. The most prominent theme of \"Run, Melos!\" is unwavering friendship. Despite facing hardships, the protagonist Melos does his best to save his friend's life, and in the end his efforts are rewarded.\n\nThe Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito) - The Buddha Shakyamuni chances to notice a cold-hearted criminal suffering in Hell. But this criminal did perform one single act of kindness in not stepping on a spider in a forest. Moved by this selfless act, Shakyamuni takes the silvery thread of a spider in Paradise and lowers it down into Hell, but it falls upon the criminal to seize the opportunity and pull himself out - if he can.\n\nHell Screen (Jigoku Hen) - A famous artist is commissioned by a great lord to create a series of paintings depicting scenes of the \"Buddhist Hell.\" The artist is unable to paint scenes that he has not seen himself, prompting him to torture and torment the Lord's staff to create his imagined images of hell. His creative efforts taint the household, as the story descends into madness and destruction.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","releaseInfo":"2009","runtime":"22 min","imdbRating":"7.6","genres":["Drama","Historical","Psychological","Thriller"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/119781/hdtvlogo/aoi-bungaku-51785d48c6241.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/4900/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/119781/showbackground/aoi-bungaku-5f838857ec9bb.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"sLPeStRHsDU","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.6","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/aoi-bungaku-series"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"},{"name":"Thriller","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Thriller"}]},{"id":"kitsu:5944","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Sekaiichi Hatsukoi","aliases":["Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi - World's Greatest First Love","Sekaiichi Hatsukoi","Sekai-ichi Hatsukoi","Sekai'ichi Hatsukoi","World's Greatest First Love"],"description":"In Sekaiichi Hatsukoi, Onodera Ritsu is a renowned literary editor, and he's so passionate about his career that he doesn't have much time for anything else.

But aspirations don't pay the rent, so in order to get by, he has joined the death metal band known as Detroit Metal City. On stage, Souichi becomes lead singer and guitarist Johannes Krauser II, publicized as a demon from hell that murdered his own parents and committed numerous other atrocities. Souichi’s band mates find themselves in similar predicaments; drummer Terumichi Nishida, stage name Camus, is actually an avid otaku who particularly enjoys ecchi anime, while bassist Masayuki Wada takes on the persona of Alexander Jagi, even though he would rather perform in a visual kei band.\nDespite loathing the music he plays, Souichi just cannot seem to get away from Detroit Metal City. He feels compelled not to abandon his fellow band members and knows his success with pop music is nowhere near what he can do as Johannes Krauser II.

And it is not long before Daisuke realizes that he is not the only one with a fated family legacy—his greatest adversary could be the one classmate he is most unwilling to fight. \n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2003","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.0","genres":["Action","Comedy","Fantasy","Magic","Romance","School","Crime"],"logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt0366004/img","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/42/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt0366004/img","trailers":[{"source":"u41_Wclv2GE","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.0","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/d-n-angel"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Crime","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Crime"}]},{"id":"kitsu:1518","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Bokurano","aliases":["Bokurano","Bokurano: Ours"],"description":"15 children, 8 boys and 7 girls, are enjoying their summer camp together when they suddenly discover a grotto by the sea.

What unfolds is a tale of a crazy, mixed-up family, where the father has mysterious powers, the mother is a goddess, and the siblings have an intense rivalry that will finally see its conclusion... even if that conclusion brings about the attention of the Shrine, an organization dedicated to protecting the multiverse.\n\n(Source: Discotek Media)","releaseInfo":"2013","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"7.8","genres":["Action","Fantasy","Supernatural","Family"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/254658/hdtvlogo/kyousougiga-5ec8948323388.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7870/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt10342048/img","trailers":[{"source":"In4YoCWTKiM","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/kyousougiga-tv"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Family","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Family"}]},{"id":"kitsu:1526","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Romeo x Juliet","aliases":["Romeo x Juliet","RomeoxJuliet"],"description":"In the floating continent of Neo Verona, the Montague family seized control and murdered every member of the Capulet family with the exception of Capulet's daughter, Juliet Fiammata Asto Capulet. 14 years later, Juliet and the remnants of Capulet's retainers live hidden from the iron fist of the Montague family.

Alien invaders known as the Neuroi came to Earth in 1939. This is not the first appearance of the Neuroi as they have appeared at seemingly random intervals throughout human history. While the Neuroi primarily attack humanity using aircrafts, their mothership is able to produce a deadly miasma, a chemical that is fatally poisonous to humans, forcing the populations of affected areas to flee their homes. The Neuroi then use the poisoned areas to plunder Earth's natural resources to use against humanity. Luckily the miasma cannot spread across water, making the ocean humanity's main line of defense against the Neuroi.\nWith normal humans unable to fight in the miasma, witches have become the forefront of military defense against the Neuroi. Each witch is able to deploy a defensive field around themselves that not only blocks the miasma but protects them from physical attacks as well. Utilizing leg mounted machines called Striker Units to fly into combat, the witches use their magical abilities to wield devastating weapons too large and ungainly for a normal person. The series follows the battles fought by the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, who battle on the front lines to defend the British Isles from the Neuroi. Will humanity be able to take back Earth and bring peace to their home?

And as these new challenges present themselves and the battle against injustice intensifies, namely his conflict with Shin and the rest of the Nanto Seiken school of martial arts, Kenshirou is gradually transformed into the savior of an irradiated and violent world.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"1984-1987","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"7.8","genres":["Action","Drama","Martial Arts","Sci-Fi"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79156/hdtvlogo/fist-of-the-north-star-551efa121eb1a.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/857/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt0091211/img","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/hokuto-no-ken"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Martial Arts","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Martial Arts"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"}]},{"id":"kitsu:5745","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu: Matsuri","aliases":["Baka & Test - Summon the Beasts OVA","Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu: Matsuri","Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu OVA","Baka to Test to Shokanju OVA","The Idiot","the Tests","and the Summoned Creatures OVA","Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts OVA"],"description":"OVA of Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu which was announced to be released before the start of the second series.","releaseInfo":"2011","runtime":"29 min","imdbRating":"7.6","genres":["Comedy","School","Super Power"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5745/medium.jpg","background":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/5745/original.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.6","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/baka-to-test-to-shoukanjuu-matsuri"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"}]},{"id":"kitsu:42622","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Appare-Ranman!","aliases":["Appare-Ranman!"],"description":"The story is set at the end of the 19th century and on the eve of the next one.

Unfortunately things don't go as swimmingly as one would hope, as one of the soldiers, Kei Agemaki, is terribly afraid of youkai and one of the spirits, Zakuro, has an extreme dislike for humans who accept practices and traditions from the west. Life for these two is about to become a lot more interesting as they have to learn how to cooperate with their worst enemies!","releaseInfo":"2010","runtime":"1 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Demons","Historical","Romance","Supernatural","Military","Friendship"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5349/medium.jpg","background":null,"trailers":[{"source":"TmONRcfX1Kw","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/otome-youkai-zakuro"},{"name":"Demons","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Demons"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"},{"name":"Friendship","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Friendship"}]},{"id":"kitsu:10742","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Yuru Yuri San☆Hai!","aliases":["Yuru Yuri San☆Hai!","Yuru Yuri 3rd Season","Yuru Yuri Third Season","Yuru Yuri-san High!: YuruYuri S3"],"description":"Third season of Yuru Yuri.","releaseInfo":"2015","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.9","genres":["Comedy","School","Shoujo Ai","Slice of Life","Shoujo Ai","Friendship"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/250022/hdtvlogo/yuru-yuri-56f072674a157.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10742/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/250022/showbackground/yuruyuri-happy-go-lily-630b3b5131f33.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"vVxIv_SglFY","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.9","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/yuru-yuri-3"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Shoujo Ai","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Shoujo Ai"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"},{"name":"Shoujo Ai","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Shoujo Ai"},{"name":"Friendship","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Friendship"}]},{"id":"kitsu:3917","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Kurokami The Animation","aliases":["Kurokami The Animation","Kurokami","Kurogami","Kuro Kami","Dark God"],"description":"High school student Ibuki Keita has been haunted by misfortune for as long as he can remember.

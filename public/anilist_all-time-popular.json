What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2013","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.5","genres":["Action","Drama","Fantasy","Super Power","Mystery","Military"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/267440/hdtvlogo/attack-on-titan-51a64c2cb7247.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7442/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/267440/showbackground/attack-on-titan-551eb271053e8.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"LHtdKWJdif4","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/attack-on-titan"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"},{"name":"Mystery","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mystery"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"}]},{"id":"kitsu:41370","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Kimetsu no Yaiba","aliases":["Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba","Kimetsu no Yaiba","Blade of Demon Destruction"],"description":"It is the Taisho Period in Japan.

Since she doesn't know that he's secretly a manga artist who publishes under a female pen name, and he doesn't know that she doesn't know, he misunderstands and offers her a chance to work as his assistant instead of a date! But while it's not flowers and dancing, it is a chance to get closer to him, so Chiyo gamely accepts. And when Nozaki realizes how useful Chiyo can be in figuring out what girls find romantic, he'll be spending even more time with her \"researching\" while remaining completely clueless.

However, they are about to learn that the surface world is not as liberating as they had thought and that sometimes, freedom can come at a heavy price.\n\nBased on the popular spin-off manga of the same name, Shingeki no Kyojin: Kuinaki Sentaku illustrates the encounter between two of Shingeki no Kyojin's pivotal characters, as well as the events of the 23rd expedition beyond the walls.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2014-2015","runtime":"27 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Fantasy","Supernatural","Action"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/267440/hdtvlogo/attack-on-titan-51a64c2cb7247.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/8674/poster_image/medium-e2d1e71ce8e7e7e3c300153cf4a0abed.jpeg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/267440/showbackground/attack-on-titan-551eb271053e8.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"mjUzzGcuJcQ","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/shingeki-no-kyojin-kuinaki-sentaku"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"}]},{"id":"kitsu:25","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Ghost in the Shell","aliases":["Ghost in the Shell","Koukaku Kidoutai"],"description":"In the year 2029, advances in Cybernetics allow people to replace nearly all of their body parts and organs with robotics.

This has led Princess Rayneshia of the Cowen family, the highest-ranking Earthling Aristocrats, to live in Akibara.\nIt's almost winter and the Adventurers are thinking about what they're going to do and what their goals are in this other world. Will they remain in Akibara or go to the city of the West? Or will they travel to the land of the North or another faraway country? The opinions of the Adventurers begin to diverge. What adventures await the members of the Shiroe team in this second series of Log Horizon?\n(Source: NHK Enterprises)","releaseInfo":"2014-2015","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.6","genres":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy","Game","Magic","Political"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/272128/hdtvlogo/log-horizon-5c509c5fdbe99.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8313/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/272128/showbackground/log-horizon-6123835058765.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"lJrCR6up9jE","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.6","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/log-horizon-2"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Game","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Game"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Political","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Political"}]},{"id":"kitsu:14027","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Made in Abyss: Fukaki Tamashii no Reimei","aliases":["Made in Abyss: Dawn of the Deep Soul","Made in Abyss: Fukaki Tamashii no Reimei"],"description":"Dawn of the Deep Soul continues the epic adventure of plucky Riko and Reg who are joined by their new friend Nanachi.

Relying solely on his vehicle's speed, JP prepares for the event to come, aiming to take first place in the biggest race of his life.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2009","runtime":"102 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":["Sports","Sci-Fi","Action","Cars","Racing"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/71883/hdmovielogo/redline-51fe761a664a8.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/4659/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/71883/moviebackground/redline-58228c6cae08b.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"RB-2Hjj_eEg","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/redline"},{"name":"Sports","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sports"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Cars","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Cars"},{"name":"Racing","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Racing"}]},{"id":"kitsu:41101","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Iroduku Sekai no Ashita kara","aliases":["IRODUKU: The World in Colors","Iroduku Sekai no Ashita kara","Irozuku Sekai no Ashita kara"],"description":"In a world in the future where magic is still a part of everyday life, 17-year-old Hitomi Tsukishiro, a descendant of a family of mages, lost the ability to see colors when young and has grown up into a girl devoid of emotion.\n\n(Source: Prime Video)","releaseInfo":"2018","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.5","genres":["Drama"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/351751/hdtvlogo/so-many-colors-in-the-future-what-a-wonderful-world-5bfa08243c7e9.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/41101/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/351751/showbackground/so-many-colors-in-the-future-what-a-wonderful-world-5bd2bc3234c3f.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"dX0zvcxpnnc","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/iroduku-sekai-no-ashita-kara"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7846","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"My Mental Choices Are Completely Interfering With My School Romantic Comedy","aliases":["My Mental Choices Are Completely Interfering With My School Romantic Comedy","Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru","My Mental Multiple-Choice Power Is Completely Ruining My School Romantic Comedy","NouCome","NouKome"],"description":"For Kanade Amakusa, life as a high schooler should have been normal, and it would have been—if he wasn't living with the most ridiculous curse imaginable. “Absolute Choice,\" a system forced upon him by a self-proclaimed god, randomly presents a mental selection of actions that he must act out based on his choice.

With his hunter's intuition, the Medicine Seller begins his investigation to discover the Form, the Truth, and the Reason before the Zashiki Warashi can kill again.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2007","runtime":"22 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":["Demons","Mystery","Fantasy","Horror","Supernatural","Psychological","Historical"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/80470/hdtvlogo/mononoke-56b37dc8ce0db.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/2035/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/80470/showbackground/mononoke-56b37f726751f.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"5OJW9gZL33Q","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/mononoke"},{"name":"Demons","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Demons"},{"name":"Mystery","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mystery"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Horror","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Horror"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7733","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"IS: Infinite Stratos 2","aliases":["Infinite Stratos 2","IS: Infinite Stratos 2"],"description":"Second season of Infinite Stratos.","releaseInfo":"2013","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"6.4","genres":["Action","Comedy","Mecha","Sci-Fi","Harem","Ecchi"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/219131/hdtvlogo/infinite-stratos-52a0da40427b1.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7733/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/219131/showbackground/infinite-stratos-52a0db51150b9.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"HF1-h8afKYw","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"6.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/is-infinite-stratos-2"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Mecha","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mecha"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Harem","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Harem"},{"name":"Ecchi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Ecchi"}]},{"id":"kitsu:13570","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Bungou Stray Dogs: Dead Apple","aliases":["Bungou Stray Dogs: Dead Apple","Bungou Stray Dogs Movie"],"description":"The film's story involves a mystery case of power users around the world suddenly committing suicide one after another, in all cases after a strange fog appears at the scene.

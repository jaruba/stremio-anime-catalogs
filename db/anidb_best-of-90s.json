Nuku Nuku's classmates are all eccentrics, Futaba, the class president, is a domineering control-freak, who cannot leave her authority in school. Chieko Shirakaba is the rich snob with the two yes-girls who always take her side. There is a bookworm, a mystic, a scientist, and a pop singer. All of these are true to their descriptions: the mystic is always foretelling doom via tarot cards, spirits, or some other occult technique. The pop singer never says anything except as a song. The bookworm always has her nose in a book. These eccentricities add to the series' humor. \n(Source: ANN)","releaseInfo":"1998","imdbRating":"6.6","genres":["Comedy","Sci-Fi","Mecha","Action","Adventure"],"logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt0414813/img","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/342/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt0414813/img","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"6.6","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/bannou-bunka-neko-musume-1998"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Mecha","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mecha"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"}]},{"id":"kitsu:380","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Porco Rosso","aliases":["Porco Rosso","Kurenai no Buta","The Scarlet Pig"],"description":"Porco Rosso is a veteran WWI fighter pilot turned bounty hunter, who has been transformed into an anthropomorphic pig through a rare curse.

The first episode, \"The Scary Chimera Plan,\" pits them against a lunatic magician who intends to use Lina to create a fearsome, spell-slinging monster. Then, in \"Jeffry's Knighthood,\" they're hired by an overprotective mother to see that her son - a young man barely capable of holding a sword - becomes a respected knight, by \"helping\" him fight off the marauding soldiers terrorizing the area. Finally, \"Mirror, Mirror\" puts the two in a race to hunt down and capture (for bounty, of course) a rogue sorceror who's found an ancient artifact that can create loyal duplicates of anything or anyone, including his enemies. \n(Source: ANN)","releaseInfo":"1996-1997","runtime":"29 min","imdbRating":"7.3","genres":["Adventure","Comedy","Fantasy","Magic","Supernatural"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/77681/hdtvlogo/slayers-5c4ad7c1db245.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/1051/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/77681/showbackground/slayers-5a184d786361b.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/slayers-special"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"}]},{"id":"kitsu:1753","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Photon","aliases":["Photon: The Idiot Adventures","Photon"],"description":"Photon Earth is a young and gentle boy with superhuman strength and \"Baka\" (meaning \"idiot\" in Japanese) scribbled on his forehead (apparently by his troublemaking friend Aun Freya).

What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2013","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.5","genres":["Action","Drama","Fantasy","Super Power","Mystery","Military"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/267440/hdtvlogo/attack-on-titan-51a64c2cb7247.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/7442/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/267440/showbackground/attack-on-titan-551eb271053e8.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"LHtdKWJdif4","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/attack-on-titan"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"},{"name":"Mystery","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mystery"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"}]},{"id":"kitsu:11469","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Boku no Hero Academia","aliases":["My Hero Academia","Boku no Hero Academia"],"description":"What would the world be like if 80 percent of the population manifested extraordinary superpowers called “Quirks” at age four?

Though his practical test scores and status as a \"Weed\" show him to be magically inept, he possesses extraordinary technical knowledge, physical combat capabilities, and unique magic techniques—making Tatsuya the irregular at a magical high school.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2014","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Magic","Romance","School","Sci-Fi","Supernatural","Action"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/278329/hdtvlogo/the-irregular-at-magic-high-school-5c4ad1d30daa1.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/8053/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/278329/showbackground/the-irregular-at-magic-high-school-5fabadd2acd19.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"v5AOTuxt2XY","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/mahouka-koukou-no-rettousei"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7515","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"The Garden of Words","aliases":["The Garden of Words","Kotonoha no Niwa","Koto no Ha no Niwa","The Garden of Kotonoha"],"description":"On a rainy morning in Tokyo, Takao Akizuki, an aspiring shoemaker, decides to skip class to sketch designs in a beautiful garden.

However, there is just one problem—the young girl has a sharp tongue she can't control, and terrible communication skills.\nWith some help from a childhood friend, Ririchiyo takes up residence in Maison de Ayakashi, a secluded high-security apartment complex that, as the unsociable 15-year-old soon discovers, is home to a host of bizarre individuals. Furthermore, their quirky personalities are not the strangest things about them: each inhabitant of the Maison de Ayakashi, including Ririchiyo, is actually half-human, half-youkai.\nBut Ririchiyo's troubles have only just begun. As a requirement of staying in her new home, she must be accompanied by a Secret Service agent. Ririchiyo's new partner, Soushi Miketsukami, is handsome, quiet... but ridiculously clingy and creepily submissive. With Soushi, her new supernatural neighbors, and the beginning of high school, Ririchiyo definitely seems to have a difficult path ahead of her.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2012","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Comedy","Supernatural","Romance"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/255133/hdtvlogo/inu-x-boku-ss-528e72dabd278.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/6439/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/255133/showbackground/inu-x-boku-ss-61313eae07970.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"FaN8_sr8akg","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/inu-x-boku-ss"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"}]},{"id":"kitsu:42220","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Yakusoku no Neverland 2nd Season","aliases":["The Promised Neverland Season 2","Yakusoku no Neverland 2nd Season"],"description":"Fifteen children escape Grace Field House, a false paradise, hoping for a chance at freedom.

Fortunately—or perhaps unfortunately for Keita—his sisters aren't the only women lusting after him, and there's no telling when the allure of temptation will get the better of the boy as well.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2010","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"6.6","genres":["Comedy","Ecchi","Romance","School","Harem"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/84768/clearlogo/Kisssis-84768-2.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/5045/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/84768/showbackground/kissxsis-61aea4957697a.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"hemw2TBFtP8","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"6.6","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/kiss-x-sis-tv"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Ecchi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Ecchi"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Harem","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Harem"}]},{"id":"kitsu:13615","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"A Place Further Than the Universe","aliases":["A Place Further Than The Universe","Sora yori mo Tooi Basho","Uchuu yori mo Tooi Basho","A Story That Leads to the Antarctica","Sora Yorimo Tōi Basho","Yorimoi"],"description":"Scenery that we have never seen.

has been locked in an interstellar war between the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance, fighting battles with thousands of spaceships and millions of soldiers on both sides. The crumbling Goldenbaum dynasty rules the Empire while the Alliance is in an increasingly dysfunctional democratic state.\n\nTwo new commanders enter the stage: Imperial Admiral Reinhard von Lohengramm and the FPA's Yang Wen-Li. Reinhard is a talented minor aristocrat given a high station—and a powerful grudge—after the Kaiser took his older sister as a concubine. Wen-Li originally joined the military only to fund his university education, but has become a brilliant though reluctant leader. Each begins to attract a circle of similarly gifted soldiers, generals and thinkers around him, and in time the rivalry between these two very different men will shatter the existing stalemate. As they deal with superiors and subordinates, maneuver through personal and political problems, plot strategies and fight battles, both will bend the course of events to their will and, in turn, be tested and changed by the greatest war in human history!\n\nLegend of the Galactic Heroes is a vast, sentimental and thoughtful military space opera. This 110-episode OVA is the central part of the franchise, and the other connected titles are supplements to it.

Alien invaders known as the Neuroi came to Earth in 1939. This is not the first appearance of the Neuroi as they have appeared at seemingly random intervals throughout human history. While the Neuroi primarily attack humanity using aircrafts, their mothership is able to produce a deadly miasma, a chemical that is fatally poisonous to humans, forcing the populations of affected areas to flee their homes. The Neuroi then use the poisoned areas to plunder Earth's natural resources to use against humanity. Luckily the miasma cannot spread across water, making the ocean humanity's main line of defense against the Neuroi.\nWith normal humans unable to fight in the miasma, witches have become the forefront of military defense against the Neuroi. Each witch is able to deploy a defensive field around themselves that not only blocks the miasma but protects them from physical attacks as well. Utilizing leg mounted machines called Striker Units to fly into combat, the witches use their magical abilities to wield devastating weapons too large and ungainly for a normal person.

Thus, Nishikata continues to strive for the seemingly impossible—to outsmart Takagi and make her blush with embarrassment.","releaseInfo":"2019","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/337936/hdtvlogo/karakai-jouzu-no-takagi-san-5c251164c3433.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/42110/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/337936/showbackground/teasing-master-takagi-san-61dc009d8953d.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"Z_iXQH8Bxog","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/karakai-jouzu-no-takagi-san-2"}]},{"id":"kitsu:10789","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Tokyo Ghoul: \"Jack\"","aliases":["Tokyo Ghoul: \"Jack\""],"description":"Who needs school, who needs baseball, and who needs friends?

Researchers and scholars of both Magecraft and science have been gathered to maintain human civilization under the Chaldea Security Organization.

The trail leads to shadow leaders, a plot to overthrow the government, and a man that Jubei thought he would never see again.","releaseInfo":"1993","runtime":"92 min","imdbRating":"7.5","genres":["Adventure","Fantasy","Historical","Horror","Romance","Supernatural"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/14282/hdmovielogo/ninja-scroll-528f355731379.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/572/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/14282/moviebackground/ninja-scroll-638d99e8b89d7.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"rQ4-uxEq4wE","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/juubee-ninpuuchou"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Horror","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Horror"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7692","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Fairy Tail x Rave","aliases":["Fairy Tail x Rave"],"description":"In a town far away, Lucy, Natsu and Happy, from Mashima's Fairy Tail manga, are on a mission to find a troublemaker and deal with her.

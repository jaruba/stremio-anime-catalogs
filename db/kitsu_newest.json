Children were kidnapped and thrown on these isolated islands by the Nightmare Palace, forced to sign soul pacts with evil soul pets: Nightmares. These devils slowly devoured the souls of their trainers to grow stronger. If the children did not cultivate fast enough, their souls will be devoured whole, leaving only an empty husk behind.\n楚暮Chu Mu, the protagonist, was an heir to the Chu Clan, but due to a plotted murder, he was thrown on the island, sentencing him to almost certain death.

Space Shower TV is a music video channel in Japan similar to MTV. Between segments there are sometimes small animations featuring the station ID. The campaign was launched to invite all animators to come and submit works featuring the station's ID. The only requirement was that the animation is between 15-90 seconds in length. In order to encourage indie artists, all videos were shown on the specially created website; and 10 professional artists' creations (including Mirai Mizue) were already there to give examples of what Space Shower TV was looking for in content.","releaseInfo":"2012","runtime":"1 min","imdbRating":null,"genres":[],"logo":null,"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/47143/poster_image/medium-f6cc23587920594d899a83a0737d7537.jpeg","background":null,"trailers":[],"links":[]},{"id":"kitsu:47142","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Dreamland","aliases":["Dreamland"],"description":"Short animation from Mirai Mizue.

This is a film that explores unexplored territory in the art of animation. One might think that beautiful pictures, a compelling story, and brilliant movement are the three essential elements of a good animated film.\n\nHowever, the word \"anima\" from which animation is derived, as we all know, means \"to breathe life into\". I thought that \"life\" means \"limited time\" and that there could be an approach that does not include any of the aforementioned \"three elements\". The result of several years of exploring new methods was an \"animated film\" that eschews the so-called \"animated\" structure. This film aims to visualize \"shifting consciousness\" through a method of filming in which approximately 5,000 pencil drawings are constantly overlapped\"\n\n(Source: Vimeo)","releaseInfo":"2017","runtime":"30 min","imdbRating":null,"genres":[],"logo":null,"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/46443/poster_image/medium-4ef3843a0cda2e23f92f2d54d674f30d.jpeg","background":null,"trailers":[],"links":[]},{"id":"kitsu:46441","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Kami no Ie","aliases":["The Paper House","Kami no Ie"],"description":"A very short animation drawn on tracing paper with a brush pen and coloured pencil.\n\n\"This work was inspired by an impressive dream.

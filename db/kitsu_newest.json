Tourism and immigration are heavily controlled—if not impossible. Each region is overseen by an AI moderator that maintains its domain as it sees fit. These clusters are refined into a single ideal, with every citizen fulfilling their role in preserving the moderator's creation. But not everyone is satisfied with the narrowly focused vision of the city they were born in, and thus, they require some under-the-table help in relocating to a more appropriate cluster.\n\nDuring the day, Equa, Ferres, and Martese are ordinary high school students; but at night, they act as Extractors—people who illegally smuggle civilians between the city borders. Transporting those brave enough to leave everything behind, Equa and her friends risk their lives in order to give their clients a second chance. But the dangers of extraction begin to intensify when the cluster moderators become increasingly aware of the group's actions that threaten their perfect utopias.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2022","runtime":"22 min","imdbRating":"6.6","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/414907/hdtvlogo/estab-life-great-escape-6290a848854f9.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/45837/poster_image/medium-053ca3d41335653337a229beae186007.jpeg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt19037400/img","trailers":[{"source":"UcujCqo9vWw","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"6.6","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/estab-life-great-escape"}]},{"id":"kitsu:45836","type":"series","animeType":"ONA","name":"Fake Identity","aliases":["Fake Identity"],"description":"Lin Qinghan's grandfather is at stake, but regardless of the stability of the Lin Group, the relatives use all kinds of despicable ways to frame the female president Lin Qinghan and fight for the family property.

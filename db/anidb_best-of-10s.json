Living in an alternate-reality Edo, where swords are prohibited and alien overlords have conquered Japan, they try to thrive on doing whatever work they can get their hands on. However, Shinpachi and Kagura still haven't been paid... Does Gin-chan really spend all that cash playing pachinko?\nMeanwhile, when Gintoki drunkenly staggers home one night, an alien spaceship crashes nearby. A fatally injured crew member emerges from the ship and gives Gintoki a strange, clock-shaped device, warning him that it is incredibly powerful and must be safeguarded. Mistaking it for his alarm clock, Gintoki proceeds to smash the device the next morning and suddenly discovers that the world outside his apartment has come to a standstill. With Kagura and Shinpachi at his side, he sets off to get the device fixed; though, as usual, nothing is ever that simple for the Yorozuya team.\nFilled with tongue-in-cheek humor and moments of heartfelt emotion, Gintama's fourth season finds Gintoki and his friends facing both their most hilarious misadventures and most dangerous crises yet.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2015-2016","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Action","Comedy","Historical","Parody","Samurai","Sci-Fi"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79895/hdtvlogo/gintama-5c75b5152ff67.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/10083/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79895/showbackground/gintama-606b79565fb78.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"W_eWXh85VS4","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/gintama-2015-tv"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Parody","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Parody"},{"name":"Samurai","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Samurai"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"}]},{"id":"kitsu:8581","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Mushishi Zoku Shou 2nd Season","aliases":["Mushishi Zoku Shou 2nd Season"],"description":"Second season of Mushishi Zoku Shou.","releaseInfo":"2014","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Adventure","Mystery","Fantasy","Supernatural","Historical","Slice of Life"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79214/hdtvlogo/mushishi-594024dce342a.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/8581/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79214/showbackground/mushishi-617146bfd59f6.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"zuX3P6ynAgc","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/mushishi-zoku-shou-2"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Mystery","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mystery"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"}]},{"id":"kitsu:10084","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Mushishi Zoku Shou: Suzu no Shizuku","aliases":["Mushishi Zoku Shou: Suzu no Shizuku","Mushishi Tokubetsu-hen: Suzu no Shizuku","Mushishi: The Next Chapter - Drops of Bells"],"description":"The anime adaptation of the final Mushishi manga arc.

However, their relationship and resolve are put to the test, when romantic feelings conflict with the one and only rule.\nBased on Yuki Midorikawa's manga of the same name, Hotarubi no Mori e is a tale of friendship and compromise of two people who should never have crossed paths, as their lives become hopelessly intertwined.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2011","runtime":"45 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Supernatural","Drama","Romance"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/92321/hdmovielogo/-6123610a10ef0.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/6169/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/92321/moviebackground/-6123619ec84b2.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"qXLSRH31Yao","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/hotarubi-no-mori-e"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7442","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Attack on Titan","aliases":["Attack on Titan","Shingeki no Kyojin","AoT"],"description":"Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2013","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.5","genres":["Mystery","Super Power","Military","Fantasy","Drama","Action"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/267440/hdtvlogo/attack-on-titan-51a64c2cb7247.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/7442/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/267440/showbackground/attack-on-titan-551eb271053e8.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"LHtdKWJdif4","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/attack-on-titan"},{"name":"Mystery","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mystery"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"}]},{"id":"kitsu:5379","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Gokujou!!

However, a small subset of the Knights supposedly betrayed their homeland and turned their blades against their comrades in an attempt to overthrow the ruler of Liones. They were defeated by the Holy Knights, but rumors continued to persist that these legendary knights, called the \"Seven Deadly Sins,\" were still alive. Ten years later, the Holy Knights themselves staged a coup d’état, and thus became the new, tyrannical rulers of the Kingdom of Liones.\n\nBased on the best-selling manga series of the same name, Nanatsu no Taizai follows the adventures of Elizabeth, the third princess of the Kingdom of Liones, and her search for the Seven Deadly Sins. With their help, she endeavors to not only take back her kingdom from the Holy Knights, but to also seek justice in an unjust world.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2014-2015","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Magic","Supernatural","Fantasy","Action","Ecchi","Adventure"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/284131/hdtvlogo/the-seven-deadly-sins-5f557b09006da.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/8699/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/284131/showbackground/the-seven-deadly-sins-5f557d309e785.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"wxcvbL6o55M","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/nanatsu-no-taizai"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Ecchi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Ecchi"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"}]},{"id":"kitsu:10085","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri","aliases":["GATE","Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri","Gate: Thus the JSDF Fought There!"],"description":"Off-duty Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) officer and otaku, Youji Itami, is on his way to attend a doujin convention in Ginza, Tokyo when a mysterious portal in the shape of a large gate suddenly appears.

Shocked with the lack of decent individuals at his new residence, Kazunari is about to leave when he runs into shy senior student Ritsu Kawai and finds himself slowly falling in love with her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2014","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.7","genres":["Comedy","Romance","School","Slice of Life"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/278196/hdtvlogo/the-kawai-complex-guide-to-manors-and-hostel-behavior-5c08e6ca7ecf9.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/8094/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt3498072/img","trailers":[{"source":"Toe2YMNqpmE","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.7","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/bokura-wa-minna-kawaisou"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"}]},{"id":"kitsu:41174","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Overlord III","aliases":["Overlord III"],"description":"Third season of Overlord.","releaseInfo":"2018","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":["Magic","Supernatural","Game","Fantasy","Action","Adventure"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/294002/hdtvlogo/overlord-5c051ea992521.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/41174/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/294002/showbackground/overlord-622f374c3ab85.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"awYU-9jVZxE","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/overlord-iii"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Game","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Game"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"}]},{"id":"kitsu:14212","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Hataraku Saibou","aliases":["Cells at Work!","Hataraku Saibou"],"description":"This is a story about you.

Much to Shizuku's surprise, he proclaims that she will be his friend and immediately confesses his feelings towards her upon meeting her.\nBecause of her lack of friends and social interaction, Shizuku has a hard time understanding her relationship with Haru. But slowly, their friendship begins to progress, and she discovers that there is more to Haru than violence. She begins to  develop feelings for him, but is unsure what kind of emotions she is experiencing.

However, rumors of an apocalypse and war begin to spread when the Testament stops revealing what happens next after 1648.\nTaking advantage of this situation, Toori Aoi, head of Musashi Ariadust Academy's Supreme Federation and President of the student council, leads his fellow classmates to use this opportunity to regain their homeland.\n(Source: Wikipedia)","releaseInfo":"2011","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"6.9","genres":["Sci-Fi","Fantasy","Action"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/252345/hdtvlogo/horizon-in-the-middle-of-nowhere-5d8b16cc9aedf.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/6187/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/252345/showbackground/horizon-in-the-middle-of-nowhere-636cbe288e04c.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"lgwFB5pgvq8","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"6.9","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/horizon-in-the-middle-of-nowhere"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7069","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai: Relay Shousetsu wa Ketsumatsu ga Hanpanai","aliases":["Haganai: Add-on Disc","Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai: Relay Shousetsu wa Ketsumatsu ga Hanpanai","I Don't Have Many Friends: Add-on Disc","Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai: Add-on Disc"],"description":"Unaired 13th episode of Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai.","releaseInfo":"2012","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.0","genres":["Comedy","Romance","School","Harem","Slice of Life"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/7069/medium.jpg","background":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/cover_images/7069/original.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"fD2VU7vsFnE","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.0","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/boku-wa-tomodachi-ga-sukunai-add-on-disc"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Harem","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Harem"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"}]},{"id":"kitsu:4961","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Jankenman","aliases":["Jankenman"],"description":"There is a small village called Janken Town.

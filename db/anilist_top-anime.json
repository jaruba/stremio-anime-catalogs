It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called \"automail\" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist.\n\nThree years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher's Stone, but their country's murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2009-2010","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.3","genres":["Action","Adventure","Drama","Fantasy","Magic","Military","Comedy"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/85249/hdtvlogo/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood-51e2acc9b4536.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/3936/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/85249/showbackground/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood-5ea09a0907f31.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"yb2R1l0O9Zs","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"}]},{"id":"kitsu:43578","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Fruits Basket: The Final","aliases":["Fruits Basket: The Final","Fruits Basket 3rd Season","Fruits Basket (2019) 3rd Season","Furuba"],"description":"Final season of Fruits Basket.","releaseInfo":"2021","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/357488/hdtvlogo/fruits-basket-2019-5c31120fbe3a3.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/43578/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/357488/showbackground/fruits-basket-2019-6021b67a10532.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"_uTvqumZBqY","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/fruits-basket-the-final"}]},{"id":"kitsu:41982","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2","aliases":["Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2","Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2"],"description":"The battle to retake Wall Maria begins now!

With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2012-2013","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Action","Sci-Fi","Police","Psychological"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/262090/hdtvlogo/psycho-pass-51f83338cf2de.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/7000/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/262090/showbackground/psycho-pass-53db3233c7256.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"70zW21l5ZUU","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/psycho-pass"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Police","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Police"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"}]},{"id":"kitsu:6637","kitsu_id":"6637","imdb_id":"tt2194724","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica Movie 2: Eien no Monogatari","aliases":["Puella Magi Madoka Magica the Movie Part 2: Eternal","Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica Movie 2: Eien no Monogatari","Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magika Movie 2","Magical Girl Madoka Magica Movie 2"],"description":"Though Sayaka Miki's wish was fulfilled, the unforeseen consequences that came with it overwhelm her, causing her soul gem to become tainted as she succumbs to despair and eventually loses her humanity.

After Nausicaä and the citizens of the Valley find a sinister pulsating object in the wreckage, the Valley is suddenly invaded by the Tolmekian military, who intend to revive a dangerous weapon from the Seven Days of Fire. Now Nausicaä must fight to stop the Tolmekians from plunging the Earth into a cataclysm which humanity could never survive, while also protecting the Valley from the encroaching forces of the toxic jungle.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"1984","runtime":"117 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Adventure","Fantasy"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/81/hdmovielogo/nausica-of-the-valley-of-the-wind-54abf92796f6e.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/529/poster_image/medium-d08b6e8d2cd75ad923bf9e93203bf941.jpeg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/81/moviebackground/nausica-of-the-valley-of-the-wind-54d049c15a33e.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"6zhLBe319KE","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-the-wind"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"}]},{"id":"kitsu:47232","kitsu_id":"47232","imdb_id":"tt5626028","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Boku no Hero Academia 7","aliases":["My Hero Academia Season 7","Boku no Hero Academia 7"],"description":"As the Heroes finally put faith in the society that had previously been damaged from an all-out battle with the Paranormal Liberation Front, All Might requests America's top Hero, Star and Stripe, to fight Tomura Shigaraki.

But calculations then proved the extinction of humanity in 2019.\n\nThe cause of this is \"realms that cannot be observed\" that suddenly appeared in various eras of history, called \"Singularities.\" Ritsuka Fujimaru, the one Master remaining in Chaldea, has been intervening within these Singularites, alongside the Demi-Servant Mash Kyrielight. He has been attending to the forbidden rituals to resolve or destroy the Singularities: the \"Grand Order.\"\n\nA seventh Singularity has been discovered in ancient Mesopotamia in the year 2655 BC. The land of Uruk, governed by the wise King Gilgamesh after his return from a journey seeking immortality, was grand and prosperous until three goddesses and countless Demonic Beasts appeared. These enemies have brought Uruk to the brink of destruction. With a \"Rayshift,\" a method of time travel to the past, Fujimaru and Mash arrive in the lands of Uruk to encounter the fortress city of Uruk and the Absolute Demonic Front, fighting back the fearsome attack of the Demonic Beasts. There, the people who live their lives to the fullest despite facing a major threat, continue to fight for their future. Deities and Demonic Beasts make their assault, and mankind stands up against it. It is the destined era where humans and gods part ways.\n\nFujimaru and Mash, the pair who have raced through six previous Singularities, embark on their final battle.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)","releaseInfo":"2019-2020","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.8","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/353666/hdtvlogo/fategrand-order-60120ed12d7c2.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/42269/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/353666/showbackground/fategrand-order-601210108d0d1.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"BIZN34WMi5E","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/fate-grand-order-zettai-majuu-sensen-babylonia"}]},{"id":"kitsu:13602","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Promare","aliases":["Promare","プロメア"],"description":"30 years ago, a cataclysmic event destroyed half the world in a fire and caused a mutation that created a new race of people called Burnish.

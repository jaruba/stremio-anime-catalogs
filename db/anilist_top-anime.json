They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward loses his left leg, Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called \"automail\" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist.\n\nThree years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher's Stone, but their country's murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2009-2010","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.3","genres":["Action","Adventure","Drama","Fantasy","Magic","Military","Comedy"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/85249/hdtvlogo/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood-51e2acc9b4536.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/3936/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/85249/showbackground/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood-5ea09a0907f31.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"yb2R1l0O9Zs","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"}]},{"id":"kitsu:41982","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2","aliases":["Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2","Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2"],"description":"Hoping to retake Wall Maria and find the answers humanity seeks in Grisha's basement, Eren, Mikasa, Armin, and the rest of the Scout Regiment return to the town where everything began: Shiganshina.\n\n(Source: Anime News Network)","releaseInfo":"2019","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.5","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/267440/hdtvlogo/attack-on-titan-51a64c2cb7247.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/41982/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/267440/showbackground/attack-on-titan-551eb271053e8.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"hKHepjfj5Tw","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/shingeki-no-kyojin-3-part-2"}]},{"id":"kitsu:43691","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic","aliases":["Kaguya-sama: Love is War -

Kaiji finds out the hard way that the worst sides of human nature surface when people's backs are against the wall, and that the most fearsome dangers of all are greed, paranoia, and the human survival instinct itself.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2007-2008","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":["Game","Thriller","Psychological"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/81234/hdtvlogo/kaiji-5cd4fab371feb.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/2713/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt1202625/img","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/gyakkyou-burai-kaiji-ultimate-survivor"},{"name":"Game","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Game"},{"name":"Thriller","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Thriller"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"}]},{"id":"kitsu:162","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Initial D First Stage","aliases":["Initial D First Stage","ID"],"description":"Takumi Fujiwara is an aloof, spacey high-schooler who does delivery runs in his dad's Toyota AE86 in the dead of night.

Though the actress may have retired at the height of her career 30 years ago, the curtain on her life's stage has yet to fall.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2001","runtime":"87 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":["Action","Adventure","Drama","Fantasy","Historical","Romance"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/33320/hdmovielogo/millennium-actress-55e23fc39607c.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/923/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/33320/moviebackground/millennium-actress-62bee017c3a8e.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"vpGrD5wUzKE","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/millennium-actress"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"}]},{"id":"kitsu:447","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World","aliases":["Kino's Journey","Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World","Kino's Travels: The Beautiful World"],"description":"Based on a hit light novel series by Keiichi Sigsawa, the philosophical Kino's Journey employs the time-honored motif of the road trip as a vehicle for self-discovery and universal truth.

With his new vampire servant, Seras Victoria, at his side, Alucard must battle not only monsters, but all those who stand to oppose Hellsing, be they in the guise of good or evil.\nIn a battle for mankind's survival, Hellsing Ultimate proves that appearances are not all they may seem, and sometimes the greatest weapon can come in the form of one's worst nightmare.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2006-2012","runtime":"49 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Action","Horror","Vampire","Supernatural","Military"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/263688/hdtvlogo/hellsing-ultimate-5fd90f5aedbb8.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/695/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/263688/showbackground/hellsing-5ce4e1b442d3e.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"KPDdligusRU","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/hellsing-ultimate"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Horror","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Horror"},{"name":"Vampire","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Vampire"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"}]},{"id":"kitsu:44294","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean","aliases":["JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean","JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stone Ocean","JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Sutōn Ōshan","Jojo part 6"],"description":"The legacy of the Joestar family continues with Jolyne as she and her companions take on new Stand users behind the bars of Green Dolphin Street Prison.\n\n(Source: Netflix)","releaseInfo":"2021","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/262954/hdtvlogo/jojos-bizarre-adventure-2012-620a1f81023a5.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/44294/poster_image/medium-28ef08897afca6eb51c6adfca03b695e.jpeg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/262954/showbackground/jojos-bizarre-adventure-2012-5aca89809c69a.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"hGQxg_FEKx8","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/jojo-s-bizarre-adventure-part-6-stone-ocean"}]},{"id":"kitsu:45557","type":"series","animeType":"ONA","name":"Wu Shan Wu Xing: Xichuan Huan Zi Lin","aliases":["Fog Hill of Five Elements","Wu Shan Wu Xing 2nd Season"],"description":"Second season of Wu Shan Wu Xing.","releaseInfo":"2023","runtime":"35 min","imdbRating":"7.8","genres":[],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/45557/poster_image/medium-0fd0a4020b34762bfe1cadb0fe5bb010.jpeg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/wu-shan-wu-xing-xichuan-huan-zi-lin"}]},{"id":"kitsu:14173","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Saga of Tanya the Evil Movie","aliases":["Saga of Tanya the Evil Movie","Gekijouban Youjo Senki"],"description":"In 1926, Tanya and her battalion return home from defeating remnants of the Republic's army.

For nine-year-old Ren, things could hardly be worse. His mother has passed away in a traffic accident, his father is nowhere to be found, and his extended family is cold and distant. Desperate, Ren runs away to the mean streets of Shibuya to try and survive on his own.\nIn the beast realm of Shibuten, the fierce warrior Kumatetsu is certainly feared, but not especially liked or respected. When the Lord decides to retire and become a God, Kumatetsu would be a natural candidate to replace him; he and the noble Lord Iouzan are the two strongest in the land. But Kumatetsu is so anti-social he's never even managed to hold on to a disciple. And until he proves he can, he'll never be a serious contender.\nWhen Ren gets lost in a maze of alleyways and finds himself in the strange land of Shibuten, fate brings these two stubborn and fierce-willed souls together, and Kumatestu re-names the boy \"Kyuuta.\" Each of them has much they can teach the other, but where these two are concerned, nothing is going to be easy. As Kyuuta adjusts to his new home he finds himself torn between two worlds—two worlds that are far less separate than either the Boy or the Beast realizes.","releaseInfo":"2015","runtime":"118 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Adventure","Supernatural","Family","Action"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/315465/hdmovielogo/the-boy-and-the-beast-bakemono-no-ko-5d2284e0a82ee.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/10065/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/315465/moviebackground/the-boy-and-the-beast-bakemono-no-ko-5742e61baa5f6.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"PkNtujKPZtE","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/bakemono-no-ko"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Family","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Family"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"}]},{"id":"kitsu:6169","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Hotarubi no Mori e","aliases":["To the Forest of the Firefly Lights","Hotarubi no Mori e","Into the Forest of Fireflies' Light","The Light of a Firefly Forest"],"description":"Intrigued by the tale of a mountain god, six-year-old Hotaru Takegawa loses her way in the ancient forest while visiting her uncle.

In addition, transfer student Ayumu Kasuga, a girl with her head stuck in the clouds, fits right in with the rest of the girls—and she has a few interesting theories about Chiyo's pigtails!\nTogether, this lovable group of girls experience the ups and downs of school life, their many adventures filled with constant laughter, surreal absurdity, and occasionally even touching commentary on the bittersweet, temporal nature of high school.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2002","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.9","genres":["Comedy","School","Slice of Life","Friendship"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79077/hdtvlogo/azumanga-daioh-5179115a8e7a3.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/47/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79077/showbackground/azumanga-daioh-5803574ae8242.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"ofW0KJjHIjg","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.9","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/azumanga-daioh"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"},{"name":"Friendship","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Friendship"}]},{"id":"kitsu:45542","type":"series","animeType":"special","name":"Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic Teaser PV - Ishigami Yuu wa Kataritai","aliases":["Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic Teaser PV - Ishigami Yuu wa Kataritai"],"description":"Adaptation of the 110th chapter of the manga to announce the third season of Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai.","releaseInfo":"2021","runtime":"9 min","imdbRating":"8.0","genres":[],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/45542/poster_image/medium-a0d5559d44885497cc90055340bb8435.jpeg","background":null,"trailers":[{"source":"cxTxrKrYkcY","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.0","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/kaguya-sama-wa-kokurasetai-ultra-romantic-teaser-pv-ishigami-yuu-wa-kataritai"}]},{"id":"kitsu:44609","type":"series","animeType":"ONA","name":"Douluo Dalu: Qian Hua Xi Jin","aliases":["Douluo Dalu 4th Season","Douluo Dalu 1st Season Part 4","Soul Land 4th Season","斗罗大陆 第四部分","Douluo Dalu Part 4","Soul Land Part 4"],"description":"Fourth part of Douluo Dalu.","releaseInfo":"2020","runtime":"20 min","imdbRating":"8.0","genres":[],"logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt8948436/img","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/44609/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt8948436/img","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"8.0","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/douluo-dalu-qian-hua-xi-jin"}]},{"id":"kitsu:12628","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Girls & Panzer: Saishuushou Part 1","aliases":["Girls und Panzer: The Final Chapter Part 1","Girls & Panzer: Saishuushou Part 1","Girls und Panzer das Finale"],"description":"Rumor has it that Momo Kawashima, former student council member at Ooarai Girls Academy, is bound to repeat a year.

The last era in which Magecraft still existed. Society was created by human hands, but Mages grasped the truth of the world. Magecraft is comprised of techniques from past humans that cannot be explained by science, while science encompasses the techniques of future humans that Magecraft cannot achieve. Researchers and scholars of both Magecraft and science have been gathered to maintain human civilization under the Chaldea Security Organization. But calculations then proved the extinction of humanity in 2019.\n\nThe cause of this is \"realms that cannot be observed\" that suddenly appeared in various eras of history, called \"Singularities.\" Ritsuka Fujimaru, the one Master remaining in Chaldea, has been intervening within these Singularites, alongside the Demi-Servant Mash Kyrielight. He has been attending to the forbidden rituals to resolve or destroy the Singularities: the \"Grand Order.\"\n\nA seventh Singularity has been discovered in ancient Mesopotamia in the year 2655 BC. The land of Uruk, governed by the wise King Gilgamesh after his return from a journey seeking immortality, was grand and prosperous until three goddesses and countless Demonic Beasts appeared. These enemies have brought Uruk to the brink of destruction. With a \"Rayshift,\" a method of time travel to the past, Fujimaru and Mash arrive in the lands of Uruk to encounter the fortress city of Uruk and the Absolute Demonic Front, fighting back the fearsome attack of the Demonic Beasts. There, the people who live their lives to the fullest despite facing a major threat, continue to fight for their future. Deities and Demonic Beasts make their assault, and mankind stands up against it.

By the year 2050, Japan has firmly established itself as the leader in robotic technology and manufacture with Daiwa Heavy Industries. As the technology evolves to include robotic enhancements to the human body, the blurring of the line between man and machine triggers a sudden shift in world opinion. In response, the U.N. passes a unilateral ban of further research and development on robotics in 2067. Japan fiercely objects to this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage. In protest, Japan withdrew from international politics and chose to pursue a policy of high-tech national isolation. While only trade continues, Japan disappears from the world scene.\n\nTen years later, a series of bizarre incidents lead the American technology police agency SWORD to believe that Japan has concealed extensive development of banned technologies through the use of the RACE network. SWORD dispatches a unit of special agents to infiltrate Japan and gather intelligence on the country.

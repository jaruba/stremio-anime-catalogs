They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward loses his left leg, Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called \"automail\" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist.\n\nThree years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher's Stone, but their country's murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity.\n\n(Source: MAL

With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2012-2013","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Action","Sci-Fi","Police","Psychological"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/262090/hdtvlogo/psycho-pass-51f83338cf2de.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7000/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/262090/showbackground/psycho-pass-53db3233c7256.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"70zW21l5ZUU","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/psycho-pass"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Police","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Police"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"}]},{"id":"kitsu:4430","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin","aliases":["Rainbow","Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin"],"description":"Japan, 1955: Mario Minakami has just arrived at Shounan Special Reform School along with six other teenagers who have been arrested on serious criminal charges.

Accepting these roles, however, might not come easy when faced with the dark and shocking truths of society, and the impending havoc born from the new world.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2012-2013","runtime":"22 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Supernatural","Horror","Mystery","Psychological"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/262838/hdtvlogo/from-the-new-world-602003b8439ca.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6887/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/262838/showbackground/from-the-new-world-6020050c6547e.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"oYWBoSDpwdQ","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/shinsekai-yori"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Horror","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Horror"},{"name":"Mystery","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mystery"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"}]},{"id":"kitsu:5981","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai.","aliases":["anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day","Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai.","AnoHana","We Still Don't Know the Name of the Flower We Saw That Day."],"description":"Jinta Yadomi is peacefully living as a recluse, spending his days away from school and playing video games at home instead.

Suspicious of the stranger, she tries to get away from him but fails and ultimately ends up meeting his friends: a group of third-year fashion design students at a prestigious art school. They want her to be their model for their final project, but Yukari thinks it will only get in the way of her studies. But the more she gets to know them, the more she grows to admire the way they go after their dreams. Will modeling for this eccentric group of would-be fashion designers give Yukari a much-needed push to strive for her own goals? And what about her attraction to the group's leader, George Koizumi? Can a relationship between them work?

But between taking care of his old tengu master Akadama-sensei, avoiding the life- threatening advances of the beautiful human Benten, dealing with his dangerously stupid twin cousins, and avoiding becoming a hot pot himself in the next year-end banquet, the young tanuki has his proverbial work cut out for him!\n\n(Source: NIS America)","releaseInfo":"2013","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.8","genres":["Comedy","Fantasy","Slice of Life","Drama","Demons"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/269876/hdtvlogo/the-eccentric-family-5c7f1174b4fcb.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7675/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt2909936/img","trailers":[{"source":"QVu8qiE7Yv4","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/uchouten-kazoku"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Demons","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Demons"}]},{"id":"kitsu:6724","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Yuru Yuri♪♪","aliases":["YuruYuri: Happy Go Lily ♪♪","Yuru Yuri♪♪","Yuru Yuri S2"],"description":"Akari and her friends from the Amusement Club are back for another round of antics!\nIn the second season of Yuru Yuri, the Amusement Club consisting of the polite but often times invisible Akari, her cool headed best friend Yui, the original founder of the club Kyouko, and Chinatsu, who actually wanted to join the Tea Ceremony Club, starts things off with a relaxing trip to a hot spring.\nFrom there the girls will have to return to real life and deal with things like studying, coming up with nicknames for each other, Valentine's Day, summer heat, time travel, a school trip to Kyoto, a stage performance during the school's culture festival and much, much more.\nWho says that after school clubs have to be boring and mundane?","releaseInfo":"2012","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.9","genres":["Comedy","School","Shoujo Ai","Slice of Life","Shoujo Ai","Friendship"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/250022/hdtvlogo/yuru-yuri-56f072674a157.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6724/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/250022/showbackground/yuruyuri-happy-go-lily-630b3b5131f33.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"LGSOhBnMEoY","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.9","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/yuru-yuri-2"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Shoujo Ai","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Shoujo Ai"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"},{"name":"Shoujo Ai","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Shoujo Ai"},{"name":"Friendship","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Friendship"}]}]

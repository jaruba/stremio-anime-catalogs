But an international criminal group, Gallactor, tries to achieve world domination by taking control of the ISO. Gallactor was created by a mysterious being from outer space known as Generalissimo X, who gives orders through its chief commander on Earth, the masked Berg katse. To fight Gallactor and its robot monsters, the ISO's Dr. Nambu enlists five brave youths into a combat squad called Gatchaman,the Science Commandos. Special scientific powers and dramatic birdlike costumes make the Gatchaman Squad a match for Gallactor, wherever on Earth it may strike. Ken(the Eagle) is the wise leader, assisted by sometimes-foolhardy Joe(the Condor), pretty Jun(the Swan), eager little Jinpei(the Swallow), and strong Ryu(the Horned Owl). Each has individual scientific weapons, but their main power lies in their aircraft, the Phoenix, which can transform itself into a fiery arrow capable of piercing the most massive threats. GATCHAMAN is a series of dynamic action and tension as ken, Joe, Jun, Jinpei, and Ryu hold themselves in constant readiness to meet each new threat by Gallactor to conquer the world.\n\n(Source: Official site)","releaseInfo":"1972-1974","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"7.0","genres":["Sci-Fi","Action","Adventure"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/73887/hdtvlogo/science-ninja-team-gatchaman-5c39abee41084.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/2166/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt0068792/img","trailers":[{"source":"1Sn1Y_BFfuI","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.0","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/kagaku-ninja-tai-gatchaman"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"}]},{"id":"kitsu:49244","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Kami no Tou: Koubou-sen","aliases":["Tower of God Season 2: Workshop Battle","Kami no Tou: Koubou-sen","Sin-ui Tap","신의 탑","Kami no Tou 2nd Season","Tower of God: Workshop Battle"],"description":"Second part of Tower of God Season 2.","releaseInfo":"2024-","genres":[],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/49244/poster_image/medium-59a9149e0a9e0870fb8a4a71b71e6cba.jpeg","trailers":[],"links":[]},{"id":"kitsu:49322","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Okaimono Panda!","aliases":["Okaimono Panda!","Rakuten Panda!","Shopping Panda"],"description":"TV anime of Okaimono Panda! to celebrate its 11th anniversary.","releaseInfo":"2024-","runtime":"3 min","genres":[],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/49322/poster_image/medium-d0dc86119725966580935a527e85294f.jpeg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt33614031/img","trailers":[],"links":[]},{"id":"kitsu:49281","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"One Piece: Gyojin Tou-hen","aliases":["One Piece Log: Fish-Man Island Saga","One Piece: Gyojin Tou-hen"],"description":"A special edited version of the Fish-Man Island arc from One Piece with an enhanced contemporary visual look.","releaseInfo":"2024","runtime":"24 min","genres":[],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/49281/poster_image/medium-17edfd6ccde4e3dc0c04fed6b6a12d66.jpeg","background":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/49281/cover_image/f0c1e674d16f4193a7ed78c7eeb1aa39.png","trailers":[],"links":[]},{"id":"kitsu:11406","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Kizumonogatari II: Nekketsu-hen","aliases":["Kizumonogatari Part 2: Nekketsu","Kizumonogatari II: Nekketsu-hen","Koyomi Vamp","Kizumonogatari Part 2"],"description":"In the spring of his second year of high school, Koyomi Araragi met the beautiful vampire Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade.

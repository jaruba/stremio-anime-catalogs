She provides the NEET with two options: continue on to heaven or reincarnate in every gamer's dream—a real fantasy world! Choosing to start a new life, Kazuma is quickly tasked with defeating a Demon King who is terrorizing villages. But before he goes, he can choose one item of any kind to aid him in his quest, and the future hero selects Aqua. But Kazuma has made a grave mistake—Aqua is completely useless!\n\nUnfortunately, their troubles don't end here; it turns out that living in such a world is far different from how it plays out in a game.

Indeed, their misfortunes have only just begun!\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2016","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Adventure","Comedy","Fantasy","Supernatural","Magic","Parody"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/303867/hdtvlogo/konosuba---gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world-61e98e85485c3.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10941/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/303867/showbackground/konosuba---gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world-61d73f963c082.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"NU87y-38glA","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/kono-subarashii-sekai-ni-shukufuku-wo"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Parody","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Parody"}]},{"id":"kitsu:47694","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Mushoku Tensei II: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu Part 2","aliases":["Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation Season 2 Part 2","Mushoku Tensei II: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu Part 2"],"description":"The second cour of Mushoku Tensei II: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu.","releaseInfo":"2024-","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/371310/hdtvlogo/mushoku-tensei-jobless-reincarnation-64b101b49f0a9.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/47694/poster_image/medium-5723f4a04cd2cdc26b3cbd5c6b5e0ed9.jpeg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/371310/showbackground/mushoku-tensei-jobless-reincarnation-651693fe2c70a.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"L5broLUI1m4","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/Mushoku-Tensei-II-Isekai-Ittara-Honki-Dasu-Part-2"}]},{"id":"kitsu:41024","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken","aliases":["That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime","Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken"],"description":"Corporate worker Mikami Satoru is stabbed by a random killer, and is reborn to an alternate world.

To add to his dilemma, it tends to occur in the most public of places, and his options never seem to deviate from the rude and crude in nature.\nAs a result, the helpless boy stresses through each day, fumbling to repair his already tarnished reputation while desperately praying to avoid the next spontaneous episode of Absolute Choice. To his dismay, the one in charge is always one step ahead of him and proceeds to not-so-subtly \"choice\" him into the lives of several girls at his school. Just when Kanade's school life can’t seem to be doomed any further, a decision that he reluctantly selects on the way home sends a beautiful girl crashing down from the sky, along with the promise of more hysterically hellish choices.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2013","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.2","genres":["Comedy","Romance","School"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/272314/hdtvlogo/noucome-5c86f4a0c5db6.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7846/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/272314/showbackground/noucome-6263f01f77e69.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"W0z8nMaAsFs","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/noucome-my-mental-choices-are-completely-interfering-with-my-school-romantic-comedy"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"}]},{"id":"kitsu:43065","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Date A Live IV","aliases":["Date A Live IV","Data A Live 4"],"description":"The fourth season of Date A Live.","releaseInfo":"2022","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.8","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/264663/hdtvlogo/date-a-live-626a703c90612.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/43065/poster_image/medium-9bbf8fcae9da0520c8f6504bf64939e5.jpeg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/264663/showbackground/date-a-live-61e2d8228e01e.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"Dvn0XsA73Yo","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/date-a-live-iv"}]},{"id":"kitsu:1429","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Bartender","aliases":["Bartender"],"description":"Genius bartender, Sasakura Ryuu makes the most incredible cocktails anyone has ever tasted.

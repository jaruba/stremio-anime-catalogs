Unusually for an anime, a narrator reads Kenji's story aloud while the action is played out on the screen by a succession of warm and evocative illustrations brought to life by subtle touches of animation. If the film feels somehow familiar yet you can't put your finger on the reason why, it's probably the sumptuously minimalist animation by Yasuhiro Nagura, who was the animation director of Mamoru Oshii's artsy 1986 feature Angel's Egg. That, and Kenji's wildcat is said to have been the inspiration for Miyazaki's Panda/Totoro creature. The idea of reading Kenji's story aloud instead of playing it out as a drama is quite refreshing, and Kenji's magical language and narrative style are entirely sufficient to sustain interest.

Fortunately, a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit after the one who stole her insignia, happens upon Subaru and saves him. In order to thank the honest and kindhearted girl, Subaru offers to help in her search, and later that night, he even finds the whereabouts of that which she seeks. But unbeknownst to them, a much darker force stalks the pair from the shadows, and just minutes after locating the insignia, Subaru and Satella are brutally murdered.\n\nHowever, Subaru immediately reawakens to a familiar scene—confronted by the same group of thugs, meeting Satella all over again—the enigma deepens as history inexplicably repeats itself.","releaseInfo":"2016","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Psychological","Thriller","Fantasy","Drama"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/305089/hdtvlogo/re-life-in-a-different-world-from-zero-5c557104dfd17.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/11209/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/305089/showbackground/re-life-in-a-different-world-from-zero-604b5e5804700.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"IvhgOe9BY5A","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/re-zero-kara-hajimeru-isekai-seikatsu"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"},{"name":"Thriller","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Thriller"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"}]},{"id":"kitsu:44382","kitsu_id":"44382","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru","aliases":["My Dress-Up Darling","Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru","Sono Kisekae Ningyou wa Koi wo Suru"],"description":"Wakana Gojo is a high school boy who wants to become a kashirashi--a master craftsman who makes traditional Japanese Hina dolls.

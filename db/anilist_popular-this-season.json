After a short fight with the smoking, bad-tempered rabbit, Usahara, Uruno decides that he wants to move on... but changes his mind upon meeting Chiiko, a clumsy cheetah girl. It's love at first sight for Uruno, and after deciding to stay for her, he continues to hope that even though he's a good-for-nothing, he'll win her over someday. That is, if living with the other strange residents of the forest-- including the aformentioned smoking rabbit, a sake-drinking unicorn, a near-sighted eagle, an orca that cannot swim, and a shy pegasus --doesn't get to him first.","releaseInfo":"2005","imdbRating":"6.8","genres":["Comedy","Slice of Life"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/446/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt0907604/img","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"6.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/damekko-doubutsu"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"}]},{"id":"kitsu:40811","kitsu_id":"40811","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Oshiri Tantei","aliases":["Oshiri Tantei","Butt Detective"],"description":"The series follows a detective with a head shaped like a butt.","releaseInfo":"2018-2019","runtime":"17 min","genres":["Comedy","Mystery","Kids","Fantasy"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/40811/medium.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"047VMJlBZxQ","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Mystery","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mystery"},{"name":"Kids","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Kids"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"}]},{"id":"kitsu:10076","kitsu_id":"10076","imdb_id":"tt3398540","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Haikyuu!!

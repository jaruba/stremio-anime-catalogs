They initially want nothing to do with the rapidly escalating conflict, but after Jill's father, Paro's king, dies by his son's hand in an altercation over the war, Jill has little choice but to realize his father's final wish: the taking of Isa. \nThe only problem is that he had promised his beloved, Ahanas, that he would not become involved.

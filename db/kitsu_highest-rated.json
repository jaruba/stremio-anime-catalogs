The stress of raising her wild-natured children in a densely populated city, all while keeping their identity a secret, culminates in a decision to move to the countryside, where she hopes Ame and Yuki can live a life free from the judgments of society. Wolf Children is the heartwarming story about the challenges of being a single mother in an unforgiving modern world.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2012","runtime":"117 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Fantasy","Slice of Life","Family"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/110420/hdmovielogo/the-wolf-children-ame-and-yuki-5495fcd4081f1.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6711/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/110420/moviebackground/the-wolf-children-ame-and-yuki-583f82c700e74.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"8SlB-SpDMKI","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/wolf-children"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"},{"name":"Family","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Family"}]},{"id":"kitsu:42340","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Violet Evergarden Gaiden: Eien to Jidou Shuki Ningyou","aliases":["Violet Evergarden Side Story: Eternity and the Auto Memories Doll","Violet Evergarden Gaiden: Eien to Jidou Shuki Ningyou"],"description":"The Drossel royal family pulls strings to have Violet tutor Isabella York, a student at a prestigious girls' school, for her upcoming debut.

With only a single day to solve the case and the underground of the Stohess District crawling with thugs, Annie must put her all into finding this girl.

She remembers her conversations with Armin Arlert, her concern for her friends, and most painfully, the time she had almost lost everything.

Though the actress may have retired at the height of her career 30 years ago, the curtain on her life's stage has yet to fall.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2001","runtime":"87 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":["Action","Adventure","Drama","Fantasy","Historical","Romance"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/33320/hdmovielogo/millennium-actress-55e23fc39607c.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/923/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/33320/moviebackground/millennium-actress-62bee017c3a8e.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"vpGrD5wUzKE","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/millennium-actress"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"}]},{"id":"kitsu:41979","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Toaru Kagaku no Railgun T","aliases":["A Certain Scientific Railgun T","Toaru Kagaku no Railgun T"],"description":"Third season of Toaru Kagaku no Railgun.","releaseInfo":"2020","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/114921/hdtvlogo/a-certain-scientific-railgun-51e815e744fe2.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/41979/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/114921/showbackground/a-certain-scientific-railgun-5f35ddd9b4be8.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"7r64nTlEtEw","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/toaru-kagaku-no-railgun-t"}]},{"id":"kitsu:43082","type":"series","animeType":"ONA","name":"She-Ra and the Princesses of Power Season 5","aliases":["She-Ra and the Princesses of Power Season 5"],"description":"Season 5 of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power.","releaseInfo":"2020","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/350399/hdtvlogo/she-ra-and-the-princesses-of-power-5bf7be191ff93.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/43082/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt7745956/img","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/she-ra-and-the-princesses-of-power-season-5"}]},{"id":"kitsu:5204","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Kuragehime","aliases":["Princess Jellyfish","Kuragehime","Kurage-hime"],"description":"Tsukimi and her wallflower friends are hopeless nerds with bizarre hobbies.

The last era in which Magecraft still existed. Society was created by human hands, but Mages grasped the truth of the world. Magecraft is comprised of techniques from past humans that cannot be explained by science, while science encompasses the techniques of future humans that Magecraft cannot achieve. Researchers and scholars of both Magecraft and science have been gathered to maintain human civilization under the Chaldea Security Organization. But calculations then proved the extinction of humanity in 2019.\n\nThe cause of this is \"realms that cannot be observed\" that suddenly appeared in various eras of history, called \"Singularities.\" Ritsuka Fujimaru, the one Master remaining in Chaldea, has been intervening within these Singularites, alongside the Demi-Servant Mash Kyrielight. He has been attending to the forbidden rituals to resolve or destroy the Singularities: the \"Grand Order.\"\n\nA seventh Singularity has been discovered in ancient Mesopotamia in the year 2655 BC. The land of Uruk, governed by the wise King Gilgamesh after his return from a journey seeking immortality, was grand and prosperous until three goddesses and countless Demonic Beasts appeared. These enemies have brought Uruk to the brink of destruction. With a \"Rayshift,\" a method of time travel to the past, Fujimaru and Mash arrive in the lands of Uruk to encounter the fortress city of Uruk and the Absolute Demonic Front, fighting back the fearsome attack of the Demonic Beasts. There, the people who live their lives to the fullest despite facing a major threat, continue to fight for their future. Deities and Demonic Beasts make their assault, and mankind stands up against it. It is the destined era where humans and gods part ways.\n\nFujimaru and Mash, the pair who have raced through six previous Singularities, embark on their final battle.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)","releaseInfo":"2019-2020","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.8","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/353666/hdtvlogo/fategrand-order-60120ed12d7c2.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/42269/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/353666/showbackground/fategrand-order-601210108d0d1.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"BIZN34WMi5E","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/fate-grand-order-zettai-majuu-sensen-babylonia"}]},{"id":"kitsu:9958","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Lupin Sansei: Part 4","aliases":["Lupin III: Part IV","Lupin the Third: Part IV","Lupin Sansei: Part 4","Lupin III (2015)","Lupin III: L'avventura italiana","Lupin Sansei (2015)","Lupin the Third (2015)"],"description":"Lupin is the main character in this series which takes place in Italy and San Marino.\nReflecting its setting, the anime debuted in Italy before it aired in Japan.

What unfolds is a tale of a crazy, mixed-up family, where the father has mysterious powers, the mother is a goddess, and the siblings have an intense rivalry that will finally see its conclusion... even if that conclusion brings about the attention of the Shrine, an organization dedicated to protecting the multiverse.\n\n(Source: Discotek Media)","releaseInfo":"2013","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"7.8","genres":["Action","Fantasy","Supernatural","Family"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/254658/hdtvlogo/kyousougiga-5ec8948323388.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7870/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt10342048/img","trailers":[{"source":"In4YoCWTKiM","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/kyousougiga-tv"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Family","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Family"}]},{"id":"kitsu:5743","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Break Blade 4: Sanka no Chi","aliases":["Broken Blade 4","Break Blade 4: Sanka no Chi","Breaker Blade 4","Break Blade 4: Area of Disaster"],"description":"Fourth Break Blade Movie.","releaseInfo":"2010","runtime":"49 min","imdbRating":"7.8","genres":["Action","Fantasy","Mecha","Military"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5743/medium.jpg","background":null,"trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/break-blade-4-sanka-no-chi"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Mecha","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mecha"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"}]},{"id":"kitsu:289","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Paradise Kiss","aliases":["Paradise Kiss","ParaKiss"],"description":"Third-year high school student Yukari Hayasaka has no time for frivolous things.

Their misadventures will soon turn into a fight for survival as the inevitable release of the most powerful youmu, Beyond the Boundary, approaches.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2013","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.7","genres":["Slice of Life","Supernatural","Fantasy"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/272697/hdtvlogo/beyond-the-boundary-53baa6d191c57.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7714/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/272697/showbackground/beyond-the-boundary-53baa957ef7f6.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"BnfeVrAAS2k","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.7","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/kyoukai-no-kanata"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"}]},{"id":"kitsu:10909","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata ♭","aliases":["Saekano: How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend .flat","Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata ♭","Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata Flat"],"description":"Second season of Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata.","releaseInfo":"2017","runtime":"22 min","imdbRating":"7.7","genres":["Comedy","Romance","School","Harem","Ecchi"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/281275/hdtvlogo/saekano-how-to-raise-a-boring-girlfriend-5c49168d9a660.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10909/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/281275/showbackground/saekano-how-to-raise-a-boring-girlfriend-607bf78301ddf.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"jMk9xXikz6E","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.7","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/saenai-heroine-no-sodatekata-flat"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Harem","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Harem"},{"name":"Ecchi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Ecchi"}]},{"id":"kitsu:1517","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"5 Centimeters Per Second","aliases":["5 Centimeters Per Second","Byousoku 5 Centimeter","Five Centimeters Per Second","Byousoku 5 Centimeter - a chain of short stories about their distance","5 Centimetres Per Second","5 cm per second"],"description":"Takaki Toono and Akari Shinohara, two very close friends and classmates, are torn apart when Akari's family is transferred to another region of Japan due to her family's job.

Kayoko and Vamp, for example, get along very well and she occasionally consults him about housework or cooking. In contrast, she and Sunred often argue like a long married couple.\n(Source: Wikipedia, edited) ","releaseInfo":"2008-2009","runtime":"13 min","imdbRating":"7.5","genres":["Comedy","Parody","Super Power"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/93281/hdtvlogo/astro-fighter-sunred-5d6486f72d766.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3878/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt1773213/img","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/tentai-senshi-sunred"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Parody","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Parody"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"}]},{"id":"kitsu:4924","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam 00 Special Edition","aliases":["Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Special Edition","Kidou Senshi Gundam 00 Special Edition","Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Special Edition I: Celestial Being","Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Special Edition II: End of World","Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Special Edition III: Return of World"],"description":"Condensed version of both the first and second seasons of Gundam 00 featuring some new animated sequences and some partially re-recorded dialogue.

Frustrated, he plans on returning things to their past state, but his mother threw the Moshimo-box away. \nOne day, Doraemon and his friends meet Professor Mangetsu, who studies magic and magical beings such as goblins, and his daughter Miyoko, and are warned of the dangerous approximation of the \"star of the Underworld\" to the Earth's orbit. \nWith the future of the planet at stake, the group must travel to the Underworld and pierce the heart of the Underworld King with a silver dart, as detailed in the ancient texts of \"The Chronicles of the Underworld\". Their attempts are, however, thwarted and Miyoko captured. \nDoraemon and his friends then decided to use the Time Machine to return to the past and, using Dorami's Moshimo-box, they manage to restore the Earth. The events on the Underworld continue, however, to take place in a Parallel Universe, where Miyoko is still captive. As a result, the group is once again forced to travel to the Underworld and defeat its tyrannical ruler once and for all. \n(Source: AniDB)","releaseInfo":"2007","runtime":"115 min","imdbRating":"7.5","genres":["Adventure","Comedy","Fantasy"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/2436/medium.jpg","background":null,"trailers":[{"source":"L63JctjGPy8","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/doraemon-nobita-s-new-great-adventure-into-the-underworld"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"}]},{"id":"kitsu:4123","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Ranma ½: Akumu!

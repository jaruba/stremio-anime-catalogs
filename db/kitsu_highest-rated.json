Forced to learn how to handle the ship's innovative technology while dealing with the onslaught of Gamilas fleets, the inexperienced cast of Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199 must summon every inch of their resolve to survive the many hardships aboard the Yamato and complete their mission: to save humanity before it's too late.\n\n(Source: MAL)","releaseInfo":"2012-2013","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"8.0","genres":["Sci-Fi","Space","Military","Drama","Action"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/259675/hdtvlogo/space-battleship-yamato-2199-5676ca14cb258.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/6646/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/259675/showbackground/space-battleship-yamato-2199-6385a16fb9432.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"51utm_LNX8E","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.0","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/uchuu-senkan-yamato-2199"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Space","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Space"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"}]},{"id":"kitsu:42909","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Enen no Shouboutai: Ni no Shou","aliases":["Fire Force Season 2","Enen no Shouboutai: Ni no Shou","Enen no Shouboutai 2nd Season"],"description":"The Fire Force seeks out the next Pillar and protects humanity from another Great Cataclysm from occurring!(Source: Crunchyroll)","releaseInfo":"2020","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"8.0","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/355480/hdtvlogo/fire-force-5d29f88e40bf9.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/42909/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/355480/showbackground/fire-force-6225f6a5be71a.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"0qBa70CeVfM","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.0","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/enen-no-shouboutai-ni-no-shou"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7904","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Girls & Panzer Movie","aliases":["Girls und Panzer der Film","Girls & Panzer Movie","Girls und Panzer Movie","Gekijouban Girls und Panzer","Girls & Panzer Gekijouban"],"description":"Sometime after the 63rd sensha-dou tournament, the Japanese Ministry of Education decides to move forward with its plan to decommission Ooarai Girls High School despite their recent triumph in the championship.

One day, he finds a mysterious blue card, which he slides through a scanner toy to use in the popular battle game. His toy suddenly glows and transforms into a Digivice, and Takato's fan-made design, Guilmon, materialises in front of him. Thrilled by the prospect of having a real-life Digimon, Takato embraces his new partner, and his adventures as a Digimon Tamer begin.\nTakato quickly discovers that being a Digimon Tamer is not all fun and games—in reality, it's much more dangerous than the card games he's accustomed to. Wild Digimon have begun to appear all across Japan, causing rampages that result in chaos and mayhem. Armed with his Digivice, which can scan trading cards to strengthen Guilmon, Takato and his new partner set out to combat the rogue Digimon.

When it comes to boys, however, she is hopelessly shy. \nOne day, on her way home from school, Kaede walks into a mysterious shop and buys a colorful cocoa mug. When she reaches home, she casually peeks into the bottom of the mug and discovers an engraved note, which says, \"If you read this message aloud while pouring hot cocoa into the mug, a love fairy (\"muglox\") will appear and grant your every wish.\" The skeptical but curious Kaede follows the directions and announces her wish to date Yuuki, the class heartthrob. Suddenly, the adorable blue Mirumo appears! We soon find out, however, that this cute little muglox would rather eat chocolate and create mischief than help Kaede. \nMirumo, it seems, is prince of the muglox world. Horrified at the prospect of having to marry Rirumu, his princess bride-to-be, Mirumo has escaped the muglox world. Hot on his heels, however, are Rirumu, Yashichi the bounty hunter, and a cast of hundreds of muglox ranging from the good to the bad to the nutty.

The RSF is often regarded as a failure both by the country's citizens and a government more interested in precipitating a war with a neighboring country than scientific achievement. Following the funeral of a fellow cadet, an unmotivated Shiro is walking in the city one night, when he bumps into Riquinni Nonderaiko, a young, pious woman, genuinely enthusiastic about the significance of space exploration.\nAs the two gradually bond, Riquinni's encouragement inspires Shiro to volunteer as a pilot for a prospective rocket ship, potentially becoming Honneamise's first man in space. Shiro and the RSF are soon joined by a team of elderly but eager scientists and engineers, and together, they embark on a mission to mold their nation's space program into a success. However, their efforts soon catch the attention of the government, which seems to have a different plan for the RSF in mind. Even as the odds are stacked against them, these men and women continue to stubbornly look to the sky, because somewhere among the frontiers of space may lie humanity's last chance at redemption.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"1987","runtime":"121 min","imdbRating":"7.5","genres":["Sci-Fi","Space","Military","Drama","Action"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/20043/hdmovielogo/royal-space-force-wings-of-honneamise-58318fbfd296f.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/924/poster_image/medium-74c16b5c5b8b60e82ca1ab31c4a2edd8.jpeg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt0093207/img","trailers":[{"source":"OnjtFjJ3XZY","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/ouritsu-uchuugun-honneamise-no-tsubasa"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Space","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Space"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"}]},{"id":"kitsu:13722","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Comic Girls","aliases":["Comic Girls"],"description":"Moeta Kaoruko (Pen name: Kaos) is 15 years old, a high school student and 4-panel manga artist!

As a result of this mishap, the Onmyou Agency was established in order to exorcise further spiritual disasters and combat the demons that would make their way into the world.\nNow, Onmyoudou has become far more modern, simplified, and refined for use in a wide variety of applications such as medicine and technology.

Despite an old promise to protect Natsume, the heir of the Tsuchimikado's main family and Yakou's supposed reincarnation, as her familiar, Harutora has no talent and chooses to live a normal life instead. But when a prominent member of the Onmyou Agency attempts to recreate the same experiment which led to Japan's downfall, he decides to make good on his word and fight by Natsume's side.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2013-2014","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Comedy","Magic","Supernatural","Super Power","School","Romance"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/272043/hdtvlogo/tokyo-ravens-5c7198ddcac04.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/7359/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/272043/showbackground/tokyo-ravens-53e9ca171376d.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"7MuxbeVaoDM","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/tokyo-ravens"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"}]},{"id":"kitsu:6439","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Inu x Boku SS","aliases":["Inu X Boku Secret Service","Inu x Boku SS","Youko x Boku SS"],"description":"Ririchiyo Shirakiin is the sheltered daughter of a renowned family.

Yet Kotoko remains optimistic that, because she now lives in his house, her unattainable crush on the genius since the beginning of high school has never been more within reach.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2008","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Comedy","Romance"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/82735/hdtvlogo/itazura-na-kiss-5c899ca69db39.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/3218/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/82735/showbackground/itazura-na-kiss-63945685d7fdc.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/itazura-na-kiss"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"}]},{"id":"kitsu:859","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Tsubasa Chronicle 2nd Season","aliases":["Tsubasa RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE Season Two","Tsubasa Chronicle 2nd Season","Tsubasa Chronicles - Second Season","Tsubasa: RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE"],"description":"Syaoran, Sakura, Kurogane, Fai and Mokona's journey through to different world's continue as they search for Sakura's feathers.

Despite their intention to qualify for the national band competition, as they currently are, just competing in the local festival will be a challenge—unless the new band advisor Noboru Taki does something about it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2016","runtime":"103 min","imdbRating":"7.3","genres":["School","Music"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/11475/medium.jpg","background":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/cover_images/11475/original.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"-ALVld2Z4zk","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/hibike-euphonium-movie-kitauji-koukou-suisougaku-bu-e-youkoso"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Music","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Music"}]},{"id":"kitsu:5318","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Crayon Shin-chan Movie 18: Chou Jikuu!

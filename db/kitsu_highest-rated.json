And thus begins the story of One Punch Man, an action-comedy that follows an eccentric individual who longs to fight strong enemies that can hopefully give him the excitement he once felt and just maybe, he'll become popular in the process.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2015","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.4","genres":["Action","Comedy","Parody","Sci-Fi","Super Power","Supernatural"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/293088/hdtvlogo/one-punch-man-55fd2d46f35d1.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/10740/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/293088/showbackground/one-punch-man-568ba6a86e003.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"tMblzsXwAKo","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/one-punch-man"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Parody","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Parody"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"}]},{"id":"kitsu:10028","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Koe no Katachi","aliases":["A Silent Voice","Koe no Katachi","The Shape of Voice","A Silent Voice: The Movie"],"description":"Shoya is a bully.

However, the forest of the monkey spirits holds many dangerous enemies, including the Matoba Clan, Natsume's old nemesis.\nStretching from the formidable hideout of the Matoba to Natsume's own childhood home, Natsume Yuujinchou Shi is a sweeping but familiar return to a world of danger and friendship, where Natsume will finally confront the demons of his own past.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2012","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Drama","Fantasy","Slice of Life","Supernatural"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/82788/hdtvlogo/natsume-yuujinchou-5c08e53406554.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/6557/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/82788/showbackground/natsumes-book-of-friends-647897bc8919c.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"n_Ku789_xVo","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/natsume-yuujinchou-shi"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"}]},{"id":"kitsu:43708","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Yuukoku no Moriarty 2nd Season","aliases":["Moriarty the Patriot 2nd Season","Yuukoku no Moriarty 2nd Season","Moriarty's Patriotism 2nd Season"],"description":"Second half of Youkoku no Moriarty.","releaseInfo":"2021","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/385542/hdtvlogo/moriarty-the-patriot-63513134d8707.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/43708/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/385542/showbackground/moriarty-the-patriot-61619379e2dd8.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"bqmHv95zCZU","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/yuukoku-no-moriarty-2nd-season"}]},{"id":"kitsu:11406","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Kizumonogatari II: Nekketsu-hen","aliases":["Kizumonogatari Part 2: Nekketsu","Kizumonogatari II: Nekketsu-hen","Koyomi Vamp","Kizumonogatari Part 2"],"description":"In the spring of his second year of high school, Koyomi Araragi met the beautiful vampire Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade.

On the streets of Okinawa, he uses nothing but his wits and a \"fastball\" peaking at a mere 134 kmph to somehow achieve 499 wins in the game of \"One Outs,\" a simplified version of baseball between the pitcher and one batter. Amazed by Toua's unique prowess on the mound, veteran slugger Kojima Hiromichi artfully scouts the pitcher for his long unsuccessful team, the Saikyou Saitama Lycaons. Kojima desperately hopes Toua will lead them to the championship; however, Tsuneo Saikawa, the mercenary owner of the Lycaons, sees the vastly talented pitcher as a threat to the income generated by the team. Rising to the challenge of swaying the owner, Toua suggests a one-of-a-kind \"One Outs\" contract: every out Toua pitches will earn him five million yen, but with every run he gives up, he will lose fifty million yen.\nAdapted from the manga by Shinobu Kaitani of Liar Game fame, One Outs documents the intense psychological battles between Toua and those around him. With millions of yen at stake, can a pitcher who has done nothing but gamble in a head-to-head imitation of baseball finally lead a real baseball team to victory?\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2008-2009","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":["Sports","Psychological"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/84616/hdtvlogo/one-outs-5c7e082d4f3d3.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/3899/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt1411815/img","trailers":[{"source":"frCs_tLwelw","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/one-outs"},{"name":"Sports","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sports"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"}]},{"id":"kitsu:47234","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Horimiya -piece-","aliases":["Horimiya: The Missing Pieces","Horimiya -piece-"],"description":"A new anime project adapting popular side stories that were left out from the previous adaptation.\n\nAs the graduation ceremony at Katagiri High School comes to an end, Kyouko Hori, her boyfriend Izumi Miyamura, and their friends begin to look back on their time as students.

Together they attempt to raise Baby Beel—although surrounded by juvenile delinquents and demonic powers, the two of them may be in for more of a challenge than they can imagine.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2011-2012","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.8","genres":["Action","Comedy","Demons","School","Supernatural"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/219771/hdtvlogo/beelzebub-62d674eaa0b44.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/5766/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/219771/showbackground/beelzebub-63d765f7b69b1.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/beelzebub"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Demons","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Demons"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"}]},{"id":"kitsu:4274","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari","aliases":["Tenchi Muyo!

To seal the deal, the girl had given Raku a closed locket, the key to which she took with her when she left him.\nNow, years later, Raku has grown into a typical teenager, and all he wants is to remain as uninvolved in his yakuza background as possible while spending his school days alongside his middle school crush Kosaki Onodera. However, when the American Bee Hive Gang invades his family's turf, Raku's idyllic romantic dreams are sent for a toss as he is dragged into a frustrating conflict: Raku is to pretend that he is in a romantic relationship with Chitoge Kirisaki, the beautiful daughter of the Bee Hive's chief, so as to reduce the friction between the two groups. Unfortunately, reality could not be farther from this whopping lie—Raku and Chitoge fall in hate at first sight, as the girl is convinced he is a pathetic pushover, and in Raku's eyes, Chitoge is about as attractive as a savage gorilla. Nisekoi follows the daily antics of this mismatched couple who have been forced to get along for the sake of maintaining the city's peace.

Surrounded by these colorful characters, the new vice president must now work through a nonstop assault of sexual humor and insanity.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2010","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.6","genres":["Comedy","School","Slice of Life"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/173271/hdtvlogo/seitokai-yakuindomo-64ccac58e6ab6.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/5434/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/173271/showbackground/seitokai-yakuindomo-641972c102f80.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"vzfkD0wz7_Y","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.6","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/seitokai-yakuindomo"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"}]},{"id":"kitsu:2413","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Doraemon: Obaachan no Omoide","aliases":["Doraemon: A Grandmother's Recollections","Doraemon: Obaachan no Omoide"],"description":"Nobita misses his granny that died a few years ago, so Doraemon takes Nobita to the past to see his grandmother one more time.

The RSF is often regarded as a failure both by the country's citizens and a government more interested in precipitating a war with a neighboring country than scientific achievement. Following the funeral of a fellow cadet, an unmotivated Shiro is walking in the city one night, when he bumps into Riquinni Nonderaiko, a young, pious woman, genuinely enthusiastic about the significance of space exploration.\nAs the two gradually bond, Riquinni's encouragement inspires Shiro to volunteer as a pilot for a prospective rocket ship, potentially becoming Honneamise's first man in space.

Kahoko must now face the trials of the competition, her competitors, and her peers.","releaseInfo":"2006-2007","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Comedy","Drama","Magic","Music","Romance","School","Harem"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/159551/hdtvlogo/kiniro-no-corda-primo-passo-50e6d65dcf285.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/1419/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/159551/showbackground/kiniro-no-corda-primo-passo-61f70a9bc2999.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/kiniro-no-corda-primo-passo"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Music","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Music"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Harem","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Harem"}]},{"id":"kitsu:1245","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Future GPX Cyber Formula 11","aliases":["Future GPX Cyber Formula 11","Shinseki-GPX Cyber Formula 11","Shin Seiki GPX Cyber Formula Double One"],"description":"It is now time for the 11th Cyber Formula World Grand Prix.

It is also during a fictitious era called \"The Era of the Cooking Wars\". It was an era in which top chefs with different cooking styles tried their best to improve their skills and to become the best chef in China. It is a country where insulting a high-grade chef or fooling around with cooking could land a person in a jail, and impersonating a top-chef is as good as usurpation of authority. Chefs compete with each other in order to gain respect and even power, but also with the risks of losing everything.\nThe country of China has four major regions: Beijing, Szechuan, Shanghai, and Guangdong.\nThe beginning of the story takes place in Szechuan, Mao's birthplace.\nAfter the death of Mao's mother, Pai, who was called the 'Fairy of Cuisine', Mao becomes a Super Chef in order to take the title as Master Chef of his mother's restaurant. However, before he takes his mother's place as Master Chef, he continues to travel China in order to learn more of the many ways of cooking, in the hopes of becoming a legendary chef, just like his mother.

However, the Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union have not ended; rather, they've escalated as both sides build military facilities in space, and the shadow of nuclear conflict looms over humanity, both on and off Earth.\nMeanwhile, on the Red Planet, an exchange program created by the United Nations to promote peace and understanding is about to begin; the \"Cosmic Culture Club\", consisting of 16 boys and girls, as well as their instructor Elizabeth, arrives at the UN Mars base, and are being welcomed by the staff. Among the passengers is Anna a 14 year old girl who serves as the narrator for the story.\nSuddenly, four unidentified humanoid robots classified as Super Powered Tracers are detected, engaged in fierce combat with each other. The UN base is caught in the crossfire and quickly destroyed, killing all but six members of the \"Cosmic Culture Club\"--Elizabeth, Arthur, Roan, David, Simone and Anna, and leaving them stranded on an inhospitable planet that has suddenly become a battlefield. As the battle ends, the lone SPT standing lands next to the terrified group and opens up revealing a pilot, who simply announces to them, \"Earth is at stake\".\nThe robots who destroyed the UN base were the creation of the Grados, an alien race, from the Udoria system, who came to the Sol system for the purpose of conquest, seeing an easy victory as the two superpowers raged against each other to exaustion--however, this could also be described as an act of pre-emptive self-defense; the Gradosian supercomputers have determined that humanity will eventually cease its infighting and become powerful enough to spread through the galaxy, posing a destructive threat to even the far off Grados.\nHowever, there were two Grados opposed to the plan: human astronaut Ken Asuka, assumed lost during a deep space mission but discovered by the Grados, and his son Null Albarto (his \"human\" name being Eiji). As the Grados prepared their invasion fleet, Eiji stows away on board one of the ships and steals their most powerful and advanced weapon, the SPT-LZ-00X Layzner before fleeing, seeking to warn humanity of its impending invasion. It was here where he was attacked. Aside from the Layzner, the surviving humans have now become very important to the Grados; as the only human eyewitnesses to the aliens and their power, the six are the only ones who can convince the warring powers to stand down from destroying each other, and focus on the greater threat.","releaseInfo":"1985-1986","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Mecha","Sci-Fi","Space","Military"],"logo":null,"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/7983/medium.jpg","background":null,"trailers":[{"source":"ufM8QaPomzs","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/aoki-ryuusei-spt-layzner"},{"name":"Mecha","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mecha"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Space","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Space"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"}]},{"id":"kitsu:655","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Kingyo Chuuihou!","aliases":["Goldfish Forecast!","Kingyo Chuuihou!","Goldfish Warning!"],"description":"The show starts with the tale of Chitose Fujinomiya, a girl who goes from riches to rags and back and remains a snob despite it all.

One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade.\nA consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.\n(Source: Wikipedia)","releaseInfo":"2009","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Action","Adventure","Historical"],"logo":null,"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/3998/medium.jpg","background":null,"trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/souten-kouro"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"}]},{"id":"kitsu:3033","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Special A","aliases":["Special A (S.A)","Special A","S.A.","Special A Class"],"description":"Hikari was the best at everything until one day she challenged someone and lost.

This act of kindness will change their lives, as they soon find themselves dragged into the shadowy world of government secrecy and conspiracy.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2004","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Action","Drama","Horror","Romance","Psychological","Supernatural","Gore"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/75941/hdtvlogo/elfen-lied-51c4b311d9fb8.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/201/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/75941/showbackground/elfen-lied-5853720fb60d6.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"IItTqRrRkqI","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/elfen-lied"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Horror","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Horror"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Gore","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Gore"}]},{"id":"kitsu:42204","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Goblin Slayer: Goblin's Crown","aliases":["Goblin Slayer: Goblin's Crown"],"description":"Goblin Slayer and his party head up to the snowy mountains in the north after receiving a request from the Sword Maiden.

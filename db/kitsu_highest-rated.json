And thus begins the story of One Punch Man, an action-comedy that follows an eccentric individual who longs to fight strong enemies that can hopefully give him the excitement he once felt and just maybe, he'll become popular in the process.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2015","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.4","genres":["Action","Comedy","Parody","Sci-Fi","Super Power","Supernatural"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/293088/hdtvlogo/one-punch-man-55fd2d46f35d1.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10740/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/293088/showbackground/one-punch-man-60b6e1ee91de8.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"tMblzsXwAKo","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/one-punch-man"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Parody","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Parody"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"}]},{"id":"kitsu:10028","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Koe no Katachi","aliases":["A Silent Voice","Koe no Katachi","The Shape of Voice","A Silent Voice: The Movie"],"description":"Shoya is a bully.

So when Kazehaya starts talking to her, maybe there is hope for the friendships Sawako has always longed for. Maybe... there is even a little hope for some romance in her future.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2009-2010","runtime":"22 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":["Romance","School","Drama","Slice of Life"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/117801/hdtvlogo/kimi-ni-todoke-5c4ee008b0545.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/4397/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/117801/showbackground/kimi-ni-todoke-538b15459a780.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"9aRQlHYaluU","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/kimi-ni-todoke"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"}]},{"id":"kitsu:9725","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Durarara!!x2 Ketsu","aliases":["Durarara!! x2 Ketsu","Durarara!!x2 Ketsu"],"description":"As Mikado Ryuugamine continues to purge the Dollars from within in accordance with his warped sense of justice, Masaomi Kida hopes to bring his friend back to his senses by bringing the Yellow Scarves together once more.

On the streets of Okinawa, he uses nothing but his wits and a \"fastball\" peaking at a mere 134 kmph to somehow achieve 499 wins in the game of \"One Outs,\" a simplified version of baseball between the pitcher and one batter. Amazed by Toua's unique prowess on the mound, veteran slugger Kojima Hiromichi artfully scouts the pitcher for his long unsuccessful team, the Saikyou Saitama Lycaons. Kojima desperately hopes Toua will lead them to the championship; however, Tsuneo Saikawa, the mercenary owner of the Lycaons, sees the vastly talented pitcher as a threat to the income generated by the team. Rising to the challenge of swaying the owner, Toua suggests a one-of-a-kind \"One Outs\" contract: every out Toua pitches will earn him five million yen, but with every run he gives up, he will lose fifty million yen.\nAdapted from the manga by Shinobu Kaitani of Liar Game fame, One Outs documents the intense psychological battles between Toua and those around him. With millions of yen at stake, can a pitcher who has done nothing but gamble in a head-to-head imitation of baseball finally lead a real baseball team to victory?\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2008-2009","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":["Sports","Psychological"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/84616/hdtvlogo/one-outs-5c7e082d4f3d3.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3899/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt1411815/img","trailers":[{"source":"frCs_tLwelw","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/one-outs"},{"name":"Sports","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sports"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"}]},{"id":"kitsu:47234","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Horimiya -piece-","aliases":["Horimiya: The Missing Pieces","Horimiya -piece-"],"description":"A new anime project adapting popular side stories that were left out from the previous adaptation.\n\nAs the graduation ceremony at Katagiri High School comes to an end, Kyouko Hori, her boyfriend Izumi Miyamura, and their friends begin to look back on their time as students.

Though they mix as well as oil and water, Tiger and Bunny must learn to work together, both for the sake of their careers and to face the looming threats within Stern Bild.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2011","runtime":"9 min","imdbRating":"7.9","genres":["Action","Comedy","Mystery","Super Power"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/246381/hdtvlogo/tiger--bunny-62d487b93c233.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/5953/poster_image/medium-8ee5d9c4eefaeccc77c338373b462100.jpeg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt2061527/img","trailers":[{"source":"KaHXlxD5BMQ","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.9","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/tiger-bunny"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Mystery","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mystery"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"}]},{"id":"kitsu:4705","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 Special Edition Zero Requiem","aliases":["Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 Special Edition Zero Requiem","Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2 Special Edition Zero Requiem"],"description":"An OVA summarizing all 25 episodes of season 2.","releaseInfo":"2009","runtime":"116 min","imdbRating":"7.9","genres":["Action","Mecha","Super Power","Military"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79525/hdtvlogo/code-geass-lelouch-of-the-rebellion-51ae1b055f305.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/4705/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79525/showbackground/code-geass-lelouch-of-the-rebellion-5fc396bdcbd0f.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.9","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/code-geass-lelouch-of-the-rebellion-r2-special-edition-zero-requiem"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Mecha","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mecha"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"}]},{"id":"kitsu:43576","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Uma Musume: Pretty Derby Season 2","aliases":["Uma Musume: Pretty Derby Season 2","Umamusume: Pretty Derby Season 2"],"description":"Toukai Teiou, who has adored the undefeated Symboli Rudolph and is aiming for the Triple Crown, is attracting attention all over Japan ahead of the upcoming Japan Derby's race.\n\n(Source: Anime News Network)","releaseInfo":"2021","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.9","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/344220/hdtvlogo/uma-musume-pretty-derby-5c7fd37409c73.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/43576/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/344220/showbackground/umamusume-pretty-derby-61b6b8e65f608.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.9","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/uma-musume-pretty-derby-season-2"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7116","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Death Billiards","aliases":["Death Billiards","Wakate Animator Ikusei Project","2012 Young Animator Training Project","Anime Mirai 2012"],"description":"Two men have just arrived at a location known as Quindecim and are unable to remember how they got there.

(Hashire, Melos!), Natsume Soseki’s Kokoro, Ryunosuke Akutagawa’s Hell Screen (Jigoku Hen) &amp; The Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito), and Ango Sakaguchi's In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita).\n\nNo Longer Human (Ningen Shikkaku) - A high school student becomes lost and alienated. Despondent and aimless, he falls into a cycle of self abuse, depression and drugs that taints his life for years. Told in four chapters, each chapter deals with a different point in his life and the final chapter leaves him standing alone - an empty and hollow caricature of his former self.\n\nIn the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita) - A love story between a 12th-century woman and a mountain bandit who abducts her.\n\nKokoro - A 1914 tale of a young man's life journey during the Meiji era. The work deals with the transition from the Japanese Meiji society to the modern era, by exploring the friendship between a young man and an older man he calls \"Sensei\". It continues the theme of isolation developed in Soseki's previous works, here in the context of interwoven strands of egoism and guilt, as opposed to shame.\n\nRun, Melos! (Hashire, Melos!) - An updated retelling of a classic Greek tale of the story of Damon and Pythias. The most prominent theme of \"Run, Melos!\" is unwavering friendship. Despite facing hardships, the protagonist Melos does his best to save his friend's life, and in the end his efforts are rewarded.\n\nThe Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito) - The Buddha Shakyamuni chances to notice a cold-hearted criminal suffering in Hell. But this criminal did perform one single act of kindness in not stepping on a spider in a forest. Moved by this selfless act, Shakyamuni takes the silvery thread of a spider in Paradise and lowers it down into Hell, but it falls upon the criminal to seize the opportunity and pull himself out - if he can.\n\nHell Screen (Jigoku Hen) - A famous artist is commissioned by a great lord to create a series of paintings depicting scenes of the \"Buddhist Hell.\" The artist is unable to paint scenes that he has not seen himself, prompting him to torture and torment the Lord's staff to create his imagined images of hell. His creative efforts taint the household, as the story descends into madness and destruction.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","releaseInfo":"2009","runtime":"22 min","imdbRating":"7.7","genres":["Drama","Historical","Psychological","Thriller"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/119781/hdtvlogo/aoi-bungaku-51785d48c6241.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/4900/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/119781/showbackground/aoi-bungaku-5f838857ec9bb.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"sLPeStRHsDU","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.7","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/aoi-bungaku-series"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"},{"name":"Thriller","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Thriller"}]},{"id":"kitsu:3800","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Ichigo Mashimaro Encore","aliases":["Strawberry Marshmallow Encore","Ichigo Mashimaro Encore","Ichigo Mashimaro OVA 2"],"description":"Ichigo Mashimaro encore is a two-episode OVA continues onwards from the previous set of OVAs of Ichigo Mashimaro.","releaseInfo":"2009","runtime":"27 min","imdbRating":"7.7","genres":["Comedy","Slice of Life"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/81007/hdtvlogo/ichigo-mashimaro-527bacafa2856.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3800/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/81007/showbackground/ichigo-mashimaro-527baeccc676f.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.7","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/ichigo-mashimaro-encore"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"}]},{"id":"kitsu:2558","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Candy Candy: Candy no Natsu Yasumi","aliases":["Candy Candy: Candy's Summer Vacation","Candy Candy: Candy no Natsu Yasumi","Candy Candy's Summer Holidays"],"description":"A continuation of the television series.","releaseInfo":"1978","runtime":"18 min","imdbRating":"7.7","genres":["Drama","Slice of Life"],"logo":null,"poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/2558/medium.jpg","background":null,"trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.7","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/candy-candy-candy-no-natsu-yasumi"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"}]},{"id":"kitsu:14203","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Hakumei to Mikochi: Neji to Bed to Irori to Bakuchi","aliases":["Hakumei and Mikochi: Screws, Beds, Fireplaces, and Gambling","Hakumei to Mikochi: Neji to Bed to Irori to Bakuchi","Hakumei and Mikochi: Screws","Beds","Fireplaces","and Gambling"],"description":"Special episode included in the second Blu-ray/DVD volume.","releaseInfo":"2018","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.7","genres":["Fantasy","Slice of Life"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/339276/hdtvlogo/hakumei-and-mikochi-tiny-little-life-in-the-woods-5c3eeefd7b39e.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/14203/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/339276/showbackground/hakumei-and-mikochi-63c2803d135a8.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.7","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/hakumei-to-mikochi-ova"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7099","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"My Little Monster","aliases":["My Little Monster","Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun","Tonari no Kaibutsukun","The Monster Next Door","My Neighbor Monster-kun"],"description":"Shizuku Mizutani is apathetic towards her classmates, only caring about her grades.

The twist is that Sunred (referred to most characters familiar with him as Red-san) is a rough-talking, violent and rude hero while the villains of Florsheim (led by General Vamp) are for the most part polite, conscientious and easy-going.\nDespite this, both sides still stay true to their roles, with Florsheim dedicated to destroying Sunred and taking over the world while Sunred battles against them. Other evil organisations and heroes also appear from time to time.\nEach episode is divided into various shorts of varying length. Most of the humour comes from the interactions of the characters, especially the main trio of Sunred, his girlfriend Kayoko, and General Vamp. Kayoko and Vamp, for example, get along very well and she occasionally consults him about housework or cooking. In contrast, she and Sunred often argue like a long married couple.\n(Source: Wikipedia, edited) ","releaseInfo":"2008-2009","runtime":"13 min","imdbRating":"7.6","genres":["Comedy","Parody","Super Power"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/93281/hdtvlogo/astro-fighter-sunred-5d6486f72d766.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3878/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt1773213/img","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.6","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/tentai-senshi-sunred"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Parody","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Parody"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7827","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Digimon Adventure: Bokura no War Game!","aliases":["Digimon: The Movie","Digimon: Our War Game!","Digimon Adventure: Bokura no War Game!","Digimon: Children's War Game!"],"description":"This movie takes place after the Adventure series ends.

Armed to the teeth with holy guns and bullets, the two are renowned for accomplishing their job, but also causing extensive property damage at the same time.

However, before Yuuji can learn anything more about his situation, he discovers that he has already been reduced to a Torch—merely a scrap of memory waiting to be extinguished.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2005-2006","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Action","Fantasy","Romance","School","Supernatural","Drama"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/78962/hdtvlogo/shakugan-no-shana-56d98ebb29d98.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/322/poster_image/medium-2da41d49a879995c05597681ffe89b92.jpeg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/78962/showbackground/shakugan-no-shana-56d992182efd8.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"9C2nhALMzrk","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/shakugan-no-shana"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"}]},{"id":"kitsu:11274","type":"series","animeType":"special","name":"Hetalia: The World Twinkle Specials","aliases":["Hetalia: The World Twinkle Specials","Hetalia: The World Twinkle Extra Episodes"],"description":"Extra episodes included in the DVD volumes of Hetalia: The World Twinkle.","releaseInfo":"2015","runtime":"5 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Comedy","Historical","Parody"],"logo":null,"poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/11274/medium.jpg","background":null,"trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/hetalia-the-world-twinkle-extra-episodes"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Parody","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Parody"}]},{"id":"kitsu:8555","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"PriPara","aliases":["PriPara","Puri Para","Pri Para","PuriPara","Prism Paradise"],"description":"Every little girl waits for the day she'll get her special ticket, one that will grant her entry into the world of PriPara (Prism Paradise).

One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade.\nA consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.\n(Source: Wikipedia)","releaseInfo":"2009","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Action","Adventure","Historical"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3998/medium.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/souten-kouro"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"}]},{"id":"kitsu:3033","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Special A","aliases":["Special A (S.A)","Special A","S.A.","Special A Class"],"description":"Hikari was the best at everything until one day she challenged someone and lost.

As more conflicts arise, the idea of placing honor above oneself is put into question—regardless of their answer, their only choice is to see it through until the end.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2007","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Ecchi","Fantasy","Magic","Romance","School","Harem"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79719/hdtvlogo/zero-no-tsukaima-56d06c65efdf2.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/1657/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79719/showbackground/zero-no-tsukaima-56d06dd2106bd.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"szm9Ycdp2XE","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/zero-no-tsukaima-futatsuki-no-kishi"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Ecchi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Ecchi"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Harem","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Harem"}]},{"id":"kitsu:45699","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Kaginado Season 2","aliases":["Kaginado Season 2","Key, etc.","鍵等","KAGI-NADO"],"description":"The second season of Kaginado.","releaseInfo":"2022","runtime":"4 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/411329/hdtvlogo/kagi-nado-61a7bdae4938b.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/45699/poster_image/medium-50b8c7fbf591fa423674e8ae908a8294.jpeg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/411329/showbackground/kagi-nado-61d52034554bd.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/kaginado-season-2"}]},{"id":"kitsu:6550","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"High School DxD","aliases":["High School DxD","Highschool DxD"],"description":"High school student Issei Hyoudou is your run-of-the-mill pervert who does nothing productive with his life, peeping on women and dreaming of having his own harem one day.

As the three of them start playing soccer for Kake-High, they experience hardships, romance, and losses on their road to becoming the best Japanese high school soccer team—a team of legends.\n(Source: AniDB)","releaseInfo":"1993-1994","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"7.3","genres":["Action","Comedy","Drama","Romance","School","Sports"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79439/hdtvlogo/aoki-densetsu-shoot-5c80791072956.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7887/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt0771645/img","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/aoki-densetsu-shoot"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Sports","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sports"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7375","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Saki Zenkoku-hen","aliases":["Saki: The Nationals","Saki Zenkoku-hen"],"description":"Sequel to the Saki series covering the Inter High School Mahjong Championships.","releaseInfo":"2014","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Game","School","Slice of Life"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7375/medium.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"wfTvHYjFFjA","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/saki-zenkoku-hen"},{"name":"Game","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Game"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"}]},{"id":"kitsu:44199","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Hanyou no Yashahime: Sengoku Otogizoushi - Ni no Shou","aliases":["Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon: The Second Act","Hanyou no Yashahime: Sengoku Otogizoushi - Ni no Shou","Hanyou no Yashahime: Sengoku Otogizoushi 2","Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon 2","半妖の夜叉姫2"],"description":"Season 2 of Hanyou no Yashahime: Sengoku Otogizoushi.","releaseInfo":"2021-2022","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.3","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/384485/hdtvlogo/yashahime-princess-half-demon-5f6cd8186c92f.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/44199/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/384485/showbackground/yashahime-princess-half-demon-61b4b2e18d314.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"-J98IJlE-GQ","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/hanyou-no-yashahime-sengoku-otogizoushi-2"}]},{"id":"kitsu:6101","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Pretty Rhythm: Aurora Dream","aliases":["Pretty Rhythm: Aurora Dream"],"description":"Prism Stars are performers on the new popular ice show, Prism Show.

Of course, there's also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines. \nOne day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the \"BlackBird\"). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car's previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner's death. The manga follows Akio's various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority. \n(Source: AniDB) ","releaseInfo":"2007-2008","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"7.3","genres":["Action","Sports","Cars","Racing"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/81658/clearlogo/wangan-midnight-4dbc197b54dcb.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/2372/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt3385730/img","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/wangan-midnight"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Sports","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sports"},{"name":"Cars","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Cars"},{"name":"Racing","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Racing"}]},{"id":"kitsu:598","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Gunsmith Cats","aliases":["Gunsmith Cats"],"description":"Rally Vincent knows her weapons well, while her partner Minne May Hopkins loves to play with explosives.

Unfortunately, Mugen decides to pick a fight with the unwilling ronin Jin, who wields a more precise and traditional style of swordfighting, and the latter proves to be a formidable opponent.

Desperate, Ren runs away to the mean streets of Shibuya to try and survive on his own.\nIn the beast realm of Shibuten, the fierce warrior Kumatetsu is certainly feared, but not especially liked or respected. When the Lord decides to retire and become a God, Kumatetsu would be a natural candidate to replace him; he and the noble Lord Iouzan are the two strongest in the land. But Kumatetsu is so anti-social he's never even managed to hold on to a disciple. And until he proves he can, he'll never be a serious contender.\nWhen Ren gets lost in a maze of alleyways and finds himself in the strange land of Shibuten, fate brings these two stubborn and fierce-willed souls together, and Kumatestu re-names the boy \"Kyuuta.\" Each of them has much they can teach the other, but where these two are concerned, nothing is going to be easy.

As the three set out on a perilous journey, it soon becomes evident that their path is riddled with danger, as the Ming Dynasty has now sent a terrifying swordsman after them to capture Kotarou and fulfill a certain prophecy.","releaseInfo":"2007","runtime":"102 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":["Historical","Samurai","Action","Adventure"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/13980/hdmovielogo/sword-of-the-stranger-5c311ba55495e.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/2194/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/13980/moviebackground/sword-of-the-stranger-61239575715d2.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"1D6UP9G1LQ0","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/sword-of-the-stranger"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Samurai","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Samurai"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"}]},{"id":"kitsu:8256","kitsu_id":"8256","imdb_id":"tt4431276","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Magi: Sinbad no Bouken","aliases":["Magi: Sinbad no Bouken","Magi: Adventure of Sinbad OVA"],"description":"Not so long ago, mysterious structures called dungeons began appearing all over the world.

A realm separated from law and ethics, it is a testing ground to the magic users who dominate it. As a race occupying the highest rungs of their society, the magic users think of the denizens of Hole as no more than insects. Murdered, mutilated, and made experiments without a second thought, the powerless Hole dwellers litter the halls of Hole's hospital on a daily basis.\n\nPossessing free access to and from the cesspool, and with little challenge to their authority, the magic users appear indomitable to most—aside for a few. Kaiman, more reptile than man, is one such individual. He hunts them on a heedless quest for answers with only a trusted pair of bayonets and his immunity to magic. Cursed by his appearance and tormented by nightmares, magic users are his only clue to restoring his life to normal. With his biggest obstacle being his stomach, his female companion Nikaidou, who runs the restaurant Hungry Bug, is his greatest ally.\n\nSet in a gritty world of hellish design, Dorohedoro manages a healthy blend of comedy and lightheartedness with death and carnage. Taking plenty of twists and turns while following the lives of Hole's residents, it weaves a unique world of unearthly origin and dreary appearance not for the squeamish or easily disturbed.","releaseInfo":"2020","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.0","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/370761/hdtvlogo/dorohedoro--5f2f715778052.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/42040/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/370761/showbackground/dorohedoro--600c47992d5c6.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"8yrNYhhZKqQ","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.0","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/dorohedoro"}]},{"id":"kitsu:6109","kitsu_id":"6109","imdb_id":"tt1202625","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Hakairoku-hen","aliases":["Kaiji: Against All Rules","Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Hakairoku-hen","Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji S2","The Suffering Pariah Kaiji: Backslide Arc"],"description":"Owing to an increasing debt, Kaiji Itou ends up resuming his old lifestyle.

A sign outside says the spring welcomes all and will reject none, and this is soon put to the test as a string of new guests challenge Okko's ability to be a gracious host.

(Hashire, Melos!), Natsume Soseki’s Kokoro, Ryunosuke Akutagawa’s Hell Screen (Jigoku Hen) &amp; The Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito), and Ango Sakaguchi's In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita).\n\nNo Longer Human (Ningen Shikkaku) - A high school student becomes lost and alienated. Despondent and aimless, he falls into a cycle of self abuse, depression and drugs that taints his life for years. Told in four chapters, each chapter deals with a different point in his life and the final chapter leaves him standing alone - an empty and hollow caricature of his former self.\n\nIn the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita) - A love story between a 12th-century woman and a mountain bandit who abducts her.\n\nKokoro - A 1914 tale of a young man's life journey during the Meiji era. The work deals with the transition from the Japanese Meiji society to the modern era, by exploring the friendship between a young man and an older man he calls \"Sensei\". It continues the theme of isolation developed in Soseki's previous works, here in the context of interwoven strands of egoism and guilt, as opposed to shame.\n\nRun, Melos! (Hashire, Melos!) - An updated retelling of a classic Greek tale of the story of Damon and Pythias. The most prominent theme of \"Run, Melos!\" is unwavering friendship. Despite facing hardships, the protagonist Melos does his best to save his friend's life, and in the end his efforts are rewarded.\n\nThe Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito) - The Buddha Shakyamuni chances to notice a cold-hearted criminal suffering in Hell. But this criminal did perform one single act of kindness in not stepping on a spider in a forest. Moved by this selfless act, Shakyamuni takes the silvery thread of a spider in Paradise and lowers it down into Hell, but it falls upon the criminal to seize the opportunity and pull himself out - if he can.\n\nHell Screen (Jigoku Hen) - A famous artist is commissioned by a great lord to create a series of paintings depicting scenes of the \"Buddhist Hell.\" The artist is unable to paint scenes that he has not seen himself, prompting him to torture and torment the Lord's staff to create his imagined images of hell. His creative efforts taint the household, as the story descends into madness and destruction.","releaseInfo":"2009","runtime":"22 min","imdbRating":"7.7","genres":["Psychological","Thriller","Historical","Drama"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/119781/hdtvlogo/aoi-bungaku-51785d48c6241.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/4900/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/119781/showbackground/aoi-bungaku-5f838857ec9bb.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"sLPeStRHsDU","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.7","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/aoi-bungaku-series"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"},{"name":"Thriller","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Thriller"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"}]},{"id":"kitsu:45963","kitsu_id":"45963","imdb_id":"tt6460600","type":"series","animeType":"ONA","name":"BanG Dream! 5th Anniversary Animation: CiRCLE Thanks Party!","aliases":["BanG Dream!

In the 1920’s, monstrous demons began appearing in surprisingly high numbers across America, manifesting as sin incarnate. To combat this menace, a holy organization known as the Order of Magdalene established branches across the country, all governed by the Council of the Catholic Church.\nThe New York branch is home to the young and reckless Sister Rosette Christopher and her demon hunting partner, Chrno. Armed to the teeth with holy guns and bullets, the two are renowned for accomplishing their job, but also causing extensive property damage at the same time. This doesn’t exactly please the head of their branch, Sister Kate Valentine, though Rosette is still greatly appreciated by the branch’s minister, Father Ewan Remington, and their weapon developer, Edward Hamilton.\nChrno, however, leaves them with a sense of unease; there’s more to him than there appears to be, and even more behind the bond that he and Rosette share. Placing their lives in each other’s hands, the two of them must continue to fight off the increasingly mounting demonic menace, discover its source, and hopefully complete Rosette’s own personal mission of finding her missing brother, Joshua.","releaseInfo":"2003-2004","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.6","genres":["Supernatural","Historical","Demons","Romance","Action"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/73993/hdtvlogo/chrono-crusade-51a0c559890b8.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/41/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/73993/showbackground/chrono-crusade-5fb459e859c88.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"BRLC0zVfjL0","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.6","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/chrno-crusade"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Demons","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Demons"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"}]},{"id":"kitsu:41044","kitsu_id":"41044","type":"series","animeType":"ONA","name":"Only Slightly Exaggerated","aliases":["Only Slightly Exaggerated","Travel Oregon"],"description":"Based on actual events.

However, as he is tending to the temple while his father is away on work, his chores lead him to a shocking discovery: in the basement he finds a menacing youkai impaled by the fabled Beast Spear.\nThe beast in question is Tora, infamous for his destructive power, who tries to coerce Ushio into releasing him from his five hundred year seal. Ushio puts no trust in his words and refuses to set him free. But when a sudden youkai outbreak puts his friends and home in danger, he is left with no choice but to rely on Tora, his only insurance being the ancient spear if he gets out of hand.\nUshio and Tora's meeting is only the beginning of the unlikely duo's journey into the depths of the spiritual realm. With the legendary Beast Spear in his hands, Ushio will find out just how real and threatening the world of the supernatural can be.","releaseInfo":"2015","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.5","genres":["Comedy","Supernatural","Demons","Action","Adventure"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/294001/hdtvlogo/ushio-and-tora-2015-5c807c6342785.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/10359/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/294001/showbackground/ushio-and-tora-2015-63d4b1fe83bb5.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"sOlvF6MiDTY","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/ushio-to-tora-tv"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Demons","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Demons"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"}]},{"id":"kitsu:46230","kitsu_id":"46230","imdb_id":"tt2061527","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Tiger & Bunny 2 Part 2","aliases":["Tiger & Bunny 2 Part 2"],"description":"The second half of the second season of Tiger and Bunny.","releaseInfo":"2022","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.5","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/246381/hdtvlogo/tiger--bunny-62d487b93c233.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/46230/poster_image/medium-e16103027d7fad8764d8259a0fd48642.jpeg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt2061527/img","trailers":[{"source":"Op8c_jKVucg","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/tiger-bunny-2-part-2"}]},{"id":"kitsu:44237","kitsu_id":"44237","imdb_id":"tt14323890","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Do It Yourself!!","aliases":["Do It Yourself!!","DIY"],"description":"Building furniture and friendships have a lot in common.

Unfortunately things don't go as swimmingly as one would hope, as one of the soldiers, Kei Agemaki, is terribly afraid of youkai and one of the spirits, Zakuro, has an extreme dislike for humans who accept practices and traditions from the west. Life for these two is about to become a lot more interesting as they have to learn how to cooperate with their worst enemies!","releaseInfo":"2010","runtime":"1 min","imdbRating":"7.5","genres":["Supernatural","Historical","Military","Demons","Romance","Friendship"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/5349/medium.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"TmONRcfX1Kw","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/otome-youkai-zakuro"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"},{"name":"Demons","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Demons"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"Friendship","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Friendship"}]},{"id":"kitsu:2688","kitsu_id":"2688","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Kyou kara Maou!

But then one day as his father is testing a piece of equipment he has been working on, something causes it to blow up, taking the house with it! Now orphaned, Hajime is taken in by his uncle, who is an astronomer. There at his uncle's observatory, he meets a girl he's seen before and developed somewhat of a crush on. He finds out her name is Yukino Yayoi, and her parents run a ramen shop in town. But even better than that, she's his uncle's assistant! What luck! \nBut Yayoi isn't exactly what she seems. There is a reason she helps out Amamori-san at the observatory. She is the Millennial Queen (Sen-Nen Joou), specially chosen by her home planet, LaMetal, to go to Earth and help prepare for the possible annihilation of the planet. What will cause this disaster? LaMetal has an extremely elliptical orbit, which sends it very, very near Earth every 1000 years. When it gets close enough, the earth reacts, causing all sorts of natural disasters. Although she was chosen with the idea of protecting LaMetal in mind, her personal plan is to evacuate as many humans as she can to LaMetal, so if their planet is destroyed, they will survive. \nHowever, there is one person who strives to stop her plan, the head of the Millennial Theives. Why does he want to stop Yayoi? And how does he know about the Millennial Queen, anyway? \n(Source: AniDB) ","releaseInfo":"1981-1982","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Sci-Fi","Mystery","Drama"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/85146/hdtvlogo/queen-millennia-5ccf900ad94b2.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/1389/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt0185110/img","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/shin-taketori-monogatari-1000-nen-joou"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Mystery","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mystery"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"}]},{"id":"kitsu:225","kitsu_id":"225","imdb_id":"tt0455295","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Konjiki no Gash Bell!!","aliases":["Zatch Bell!","Konjiki no Gash Bell!!"],"description":"Takamine Kiyomaro, a depressed don't-care-about-the-world guy, was suddenly given a little demon named Gash Bell to take care of.

Of course, there's also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines. \nOne day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the \"BlackBird\"). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car's previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner's death. The manga follows Akio's various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority. \n(Source: AniDB) ","releaseInfo":"2007-2008","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"7.3","genres":["Sports","Racing","Action","Cars"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/81658/clearlogo/wangan-midnight-4dbc197b54dcb.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/2372/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt3385730/img","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/wangan-midnight"},{"name":"Sports","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sports"},{"name":"Racing","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Racing"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Cars","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Cars"}]},{"id":"kitsu:2256","kitsu_id":"2256","imdb_id":"tt2091114","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Rumiko Takahashi Anthology","aliases":["Rumiko Takahashi Anthology","Takahashi Rumiko Gekijou","Rumic Theater","Rumiko Takahashi Theater","Rumic World TV","Rumic World TV 2003"],"description":"Rumic World TV (2003) consists of thirteen independent series based on short stories from 1987-2000 by Takahashi Rumiko.

Having learned important values when it comes to man-woman relationships through the previous ones of their parents, they promise each other not to be too close, not to be too opposing, and to merely keep a vague and comfortable distance.\n\nOn one hand, Saki, who has worked in solitude for the sake of her family, doesn't know how to properly rely on others, whereas Yuta is unsure of how to really treat her. Standing on fairly equal ground, these two slowly learn the comfortable sensation of living together.\n\nTheir relationship slowly evolves from being strangers the more the days pass. Eventually, this could end up in a story about love for all we know.","releaseInfo":"2024","imdbRating":"7.5","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/422721/hdtvlogo/days-with-my-stepsister-6680bb41438bf.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/46276/poster_image/medium-46b9d9e0d87257a1fece8a359e1b7413.jpeg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/422721/showbackground/days-with-my-stepsister-6656d00ee1b05.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"RRwt3t98bUA","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/gimai-seikatsu"}]},{"id":"kitsu:46170","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"[Oshi no Ko]","aliases":["Oshi no Ko","[Oshi no Ko]","【OSHI NO KO】","[Mein*Star]","Favorite Girl","My Idol's Child","เกิดใหม่เป็นลูกโอชิ","Anak Idola","【推しの子】Mother and Children","[Oshi no Ko] Mother and Children","【MOJA GWIAZDA】","我推的孩子"],"description":"When a pregnant young starlet appears in Gorou Amemiya’s countryside medical clinic, the doctor takes it upon himself to safely (and secretly) deliver Ai Hoshino’s child so she can make a scandal-free return to the stage.

However, a battle on the moon—later called \"Heaven's Fall\"—caused the hypergate to explode, destroying the moon and leading the two planets to establish an uneasy ceasefire.\nTheir peace was a fragile one, however. Fifteen years later, high school student Inaho Kaizuka witnesses the plotted assassination of the Vers Empire's Princess Asseylum Vers Allusia, who had come to Earth in hopes of repairing the relationship between the empire and its homeland.

To add to his dilemma, it tends to occur in the most public of places, and his options never seem to deviate from the rude and crude in nature.\nAs a result, the helpless boy stresses through each day, fumbling to repair his already tarnished reputation while desperately praying to avoid the next spontaneous episode of Absolute Choice. To his dismay, the one in charge is always one step ahead of him and proceeds to not-so-subtly \"choice\" him into the lives of several girls at his school. Just when Kanade's school life can’t seem to be doomed any further, a decision that he reluctantly selects on the way home sends a beautiful girl crashing down from the sky, along with the promise of more hysterically hellish choices.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2013","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.2","genres":["Comedy","Romance","School"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/272314/hdtvlogo/noucome-5c86f4a0c5db6.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7846/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/272314/showbackground/noucome-6263f01f77e69.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"W0z8nMaAsFs","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/noucome-my-mental-choices-are-completely-interfering-with-my-school-romantic-comedy"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"}]},{"id":"kitsu:46320","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Dungeon Meshi","aliases":["Delicious in Dungeon","Dungeon Meshi"],"description":"Dungeons, dragons...and delicious monster stew!?

Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher's Stone, but their country's murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2009-2010","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.3","genres":["Action","Adventure","Drama","Fantasy","Magic","Military","Comedy"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/85249/hdtvlogo/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood-51e2acc9b4536.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3936/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/85249/showbackground/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood-5ea09a0907f31.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"yb2R1l0O9Zs","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"}]},{"id":"kitsu:1555","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Naruto: Shippuuden","aliases":["Naruto: Shippuden","Naruto: Shippuuden","Naruto Hurricane Chronicles"],"description":"It has been two and a half years since Naruto Uzumaki left Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, for intense training following events which fueled his desire to be stronger.

To reach their goal, they have to cross pathways with several powerful teams, some of which have one of the five players with godlike abilities, whom Kuroko and Taiga make a pact to defeat.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2012","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Comedy","School","Sports"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/257765/hdtvlogo/kuroko-no-basuke-5417efd3c3f26.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/6595/poster_image/medium-6690f66d37de3ce038320a29a13bb09d.jpeg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/257765/showbackground/kuroko-no-basuke-5417f012ca3fc.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"FTUIs_SuQfw","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/kuroko-no-basket"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Sports","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sports"}]},{"id":"kitsu:43691","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic","aliases":["Kaguya-sama: Love is War - Ultra Romantic -","Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic","Kaguya-sama: Love is War Season 3","辉夜大小姐想让我告白～天才们的恋爱头脑战～ 3","辉夜大小姐想让我告白～天才们的恋爱头脑战～ 第三季","Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen 3"],"description":"The third season of Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensaitachi no Renai Zunousen.","releaseInfo":"2022","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/354198/hdtvlogo/kaguya-sama-love-is-war-6276a8cfe2640.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/43691/poster_image/medium-d846a4284fe6bc862e2ca72f74aaa78b.jpeg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/354198/showbackground/kaguya-sama-love-is-war-6063327d9bbfe.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"hjy7vK0hTAE","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/kaguya-sama-wa-kokurasetai-tensai-tachi-no-renai-zunousen-3"}]},{"id":"kitsu:8053","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei","aliases":["The Irregular at Magic High School","Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei"],"description":"In the dawn of the 21st century, magic, long thought to be folklore and fairy tales, has become a systematized technology and is taught as a technical skill.

When he locates one of these spirits, he cannot simply kill it; he must first learn its Form, its Truth, and its Reason in order to wield the mighty Exorcism Sword and fight against it. He must begin  his strange exorcisms with intense psychological analysis and careful investigative work—an extremely dangerous step, as he must first confront and learn about the mononoke before he even has the means to defeat it.\nThe Medicine Seller's journey leads him to an old-fashioned inn where Shino, a pregnant woman, has finally found a place to rest. The owner has reluctantly placed her in the last vacant room; however, as she settles in, it quickly becomes clear that the room is infested by a lethal band of mononoke, the Zashiki Warashi.

He could destroy her reputation with her secret... or he could twist the student council president around his little finger and use her secret as an opportunity to get closer to her.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2010","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Comedy","Romance","School"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/148151/hdtvlogo/kaichou-wa-maid-sama-511b795d66a39.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/4852/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/148151/showbackground/kaichou-wa-maid-sama-626673958a219.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/kaichou-wa-maid-sama"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7023","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo","aliases":["The Pet Girl of Sakurasou","Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo","Sakura-sou no Pet na Kanojo"],"description":"When abandoned kittens and his good conscience force second year Sorata Kanda to move into Suimei High School’s infamous Sakura Hall, the satellite dorm and its eccentric, misfit residents turn his life upside down.

Merging these events together are the kindhearted would-be thieves, Isaac and Miria, connecting various people, all of them with their own hidden ambitions and agendas, and creating lifelong bonds and consequences for everyone involved.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite] ","releaseInfo":"2007","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Action","Supernatural","Mystery","Comedy","Historical"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/80421/hdtvlogo/baccano-5ce761fd2c8bb.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/2039/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/80421/showbackground/baccano-629497ec7998f.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"W5bn87yvh_g","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/baccano"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Mystery","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mystery"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7258","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"High School DxD New","aliases":["High School DxD New","High School DxD Dai 2-ki","High School DxD 2nd Season","High School DxD Second Season","Highschool DxD 2"],"description":"The misadventures of Issei Hyoudou, high school pervert and aspiring Harem King, continue on in High School DxD New.

Cursed by his appearance and tormented by nightmares, magic users are his only clue to restoring his life to normal.

Taking plenty of twists and turns while following the lives of Hole's residents, it weaves a unique world of unearthly origin and dreary appearance not for the squeamish or easily disturbed.","releaseInfo":"2020","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.0","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/370761/hdtvlogo/dorohedoro--5f2f715778052.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/42040/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/370761/showbackground/dorohedoro--600c47992d5c6.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"8yrNYhhZKqQ","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.0","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/dorohedoro"}]},{"id":"kitsu:44393","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Sekai Saikou no Ansatsusha, Isekai Kizoku ni Tensei suru","aliases":["The World's Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in Another World as an Aristocrat","Sekai Saikou no Ansatsusha, Isekai Kizoku ni Tensei suru","Ansatsu Kizoku"],"description":"\"I'm going to live for myself!\"\n\nThe greatest assassin on Earth knew only how to live as a tool for his employers—until they stopped letting him live.

Together they attempt to raise Baby Beel—although surrounded by juvenile delinquents and demonic powers, the two of them may be in for more of a challenge than they can imagine.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2011-2012","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.8","genres":["Action","Comedy","Demons","School","Supernatural"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/219771/hdtvlogo/beelzebub-62d674eaa0b44.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5766/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt1882240/img","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/beelzebub"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Demons","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Demons"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"}]},{"id":"kitsu:12529","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Demi-chan wa Kataritai","aliases":["Interviews With Monster Girls","Demi-chan wa Kataritai","Ajin-chan wa Kataritai"],"description":"Succubi, dullahans, snow women and vampires...

Bizarre, comical, heartwarming and threatening characters come together in a series of battles that push the powers and abilities of Gokuu and his friends beyond anything they have ever experienced.","releaseInfo":"2009-2011","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.7","genres":["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Martial Arts","Super Power","Fantasy"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/88031/hdtvlogo/dragon-ball-kai-51f937761d6c0.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/4394/poster_image/medium-9eebbd9c6130706c6c23a5eb1a29c6b3.jpeg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/88031/showbackground/dragon-ball-kai-5622530f2019b.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"xHTI7-tPg0M","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.7","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/dragon-ball-kai"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Martial Arts","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Martial Arts"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"}]},{"id":"kitsu:8001","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"D-Frag!","aliases":["D-Frag!"],"description":"Kazama Kenji likes to believe he is something of a delinquent.

What sort of personalities and drives would they have to push them to seek out such careers? Lucy Yamagami, a serious young woman assigned to the Welfare Administrative Section, intends to use the job as a means of settling a vendetta against another civil servant. Yutaka Hasebe, a flirtatious young man assigned to the First Section of the Welfare Department, intends to slack off whenever he can and have a good time. And Saya Miyoshi, a college graduate assigned to the Second Section of the Welfare Department, intends to simply get through the first job she's had in her life as best she can.Servant x Service follows these three newcomers starting their jobs as government employees under their supervisor, Taishi Ichimiya, who is utterly clueless about how to direct them—despite having worked there for the last eight years. Nevertheless, he welcomes them as fellow civil servants and encourages them to work themselves like dogs for the sake of the citizens. We follow their day-to-day lives as they experience the rigors of government employment, including dealing with regulations, office romances, paperwork, and being the nearest punching bags when citizens need something to complain about.","releaseInfo":"2013","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.6","genres":["Comedy","Slice of Life","Workplace"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/269682/hdtvlogo/servant-x-service-5c705c7103ef0.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7669/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/269682/showbackground/servant-x-service-60d9881ada28c.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"4WQzmAk6Zi4","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.6","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/servant-x-service"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"},{"name":"Workplace","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Workplace"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7241","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Gintama Movie 2: Kanketsu-hen - Yorozuya yo Eien Nare","aliases":["Gintama Movie 2: Kanketsu-hen - Yorozuya yo Eien Nare","Gintama: The Final Chapter - Be Forever Yorozuya","Gintama Movie 2"],"description":"When Gintoki apprehends a movie pirate at a premiere, he checks the camera's footage and finds himself transported to a bleak, post-apocalyptic version of Edo, where a mysterious epidemic called the \"White Plague\" has ravished the world's population.

After his scientist father is ignored by the government and killed by the Mazone, he joins Captain Harlock and his ragtag group of pirates to assist them as they try to save humanity from the impending alien threat.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"1978-1979","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"7.5","genres":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi","Space","Adventure"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/80886/hdtvlogo/albator-78-5e94c88c1d3c7.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/890/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt0182646/img","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/uchuu-kaizoku-captain-harlock"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Space","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Space"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"}]},{"id":"kitsu:46857","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Pocket Monsters: Mezase Pokémon Master","aliases":["Pokémon - Aim To Be A Pokémon Master","Pocket Monsters: Mezase Pokémon Master"],"description":"By embracing challenges, learning from failures, overcoming obstacles, and beating the best in the world, Satoshi finally achieves his long-held dream.

As they spend their time on Earth, they meet two eccentric personalities: the angel Raphiel Ainsworth Shiraha, Gabriel's classmate with a penchant for sadism, and the demon Satanichia McDowell Kurumizawa, a clumsy self-proclaimed future ruler of the Underworld.\n\nGabriel DropOut follows these four friends' comedic lives as they utterly fail to understand what it truly means to be a demon or an angel.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2017","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.5","genres":["Demons","Comedy","School","Supernatural"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/318984/hdtvlogo/gabriel-dropout-5c6317bc31ea6.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/12497/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/318984/showbackground/gabriel-dropout-61c2e04590ef2.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"4eADGP3b9j0","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/gabriel-dropout"},{"name":"Demons","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Demons"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"}]},{"id":"kitsu:11333","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Musaigen no Phantom World","aliases":["Myriad Colors Phantom World","Musaigen no Phantom World"],"description":"Phantoms: supernatural entities such as ghosts or youkai that, until recently, were thought to be superstition.

But Japan was quickly defeated after the revered onmyouji Yakou Tsuchimikado caused the \"Great Spiritual Disaster,\" an event which plagues Tokyo to this very day. As a result of this mishap, the Onmyou Agency was established in order to exorcise further spiritual disasters and combat the demons that would make their way into the world.\nNow, Onmyoudou has become far more modern, simplified, and refined for use in a wide variety of applications such as medicine and technology. However, not everyone is able to utilize the magic, as is the case with Harutora, a member of the Tsuchimikado's branch family. Despite an old promise to protect Natsume, the heir of the Tsuchimikado's main family and Yakou's supposed reincarnation, as her familiar, Harutora has no talent and chooses to live a normal life instead. But when a prominent member of the Onmyou Agency attempts to recreate the same experiment which led to Japan's downfall, he decides to make good on his word and fight by Natsume's side.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2013-2014","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Comedy","School","Super Power","Supernatural","Magic","Romance"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/272043/hdtvlogo/tokyo-ravens-5c7198ddcac04.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7359/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/272043/showbackground/tokyo-ravens-53e9ca171376d.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"7MuxbeVaoDM","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/tokyo-ravens"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"}]},{"id":"kitsu:489","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon","aliases":["Sailor Moon","Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon","Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon"],"description":"Tsukino Usagi is a 14-year-old girl in junior high.

The Academy is divided into several squads, but the most infamous one is the 35th Test Platoon, also nicknamed the \"Small Fry Platoon\" due to its low ranking among the other squads and its incompetent members.\nHowever, the ever so boring atmosphere of this unlucky squad gets spiced up when their little club gets powered up with a new member named Ouka Ootori, a former Inquisitor and an excellent fighter. What they do not know is that she was removed from her position because of her tendency to break the rules and an incident where she killed a witch. The club is run by a clumsy captain Takeru Kusanagi who is unable to use anything except his sword, so Ouka's views clash immediately with the views of other members of the squad. Can they cooperate with someone who hates witches so much and will they be able to learn from each other’s mistakes and tragic pasts?","releaseInfo":"2015","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"6.8","genres":["Action","Ecchi","Romance","Harem","Military","Fantasy","Supernatural"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/299511/hdtvlogo/antimagic-academy-35th-test-platoon-5c0514b6f3fae.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8669/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/299511/showbackground/antimagic-academy-35th-test-platoon-6223446d2c868.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"Phh6NOoYcsA","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"6.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/taimadou-gakuen-35-shiken-shoutai"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Ecchi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Ecchi"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"Harem","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Harem"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7553","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Gin no Saji","aliases":["Silver Spoon","Gin no Saji"],"description":"Hachiken Yuugo enrolled in Oezo Agricultural High School for the reason that he could live in a dorm there.

Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher's Stone, but their country's murky history as well.

Makoto doesn't fight alone; he and his friend, Yukata Hoshino, nicknamed Smile and Peco respectively, are two boys who have grown up playing ping pong together nearly every day. Peco, brimming with confidence, aims to be the best table tennis player in the world; Smile, on the other hand, shows little ambition. Nevertheless, the two have always stuck together, with a bond built upon their mutual love for this sport.\n\nEvery year, students from all across Japan gather for the inter-high table tennis competition to achieve national and international stardom. Through intense training and competition, only the very best persevere.\n\nFrom the avant-garde director of Tatami Galaxy, Masaaki Yuasa, Ping Pong The Animation serves a tale of ambition with its fair share of bumps along the way. Whatever the odds, Peco and Smile will face them together.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2014","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Sports","Drama","Psychological"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/277464/hdtvlogo/ping-pong-5c72f491c7abd.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/8262/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/277464/showbackground/ping-pong-587355b3c86c5.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"ItlDaDfLBn8","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/ping-pong-the-animation"},{"name":"Sports","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sports"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"}]},{"id":"kitsu:43014","type":"series","animeType":"ONA","name":"Xian Wang de Richang Shenghuo","aliases":["The Daily Life of the Immortal King","Xian Wang de Ri Chang Sheng Huo"],"description":"As a cultivation genius who has achieved a new realm every two years since he was a year old, Wang Ling is a near-invincible existence with prowess far beyond his control.

Ten years later, the Holy Knights themselves staged a coup d’état, and thus became the new, tyrannical rulers of the Kingdom of Liones.\n\nBased on the best-selling manga series of the same name, Nanatsu no Taizai follows the adventures of Elizabeth, the third princess of the Kingdom of Liones, and her search for the Seven Deadly Sins. With their help, she endeavors to not only take back her kingdom from the Holy Knights, but to also seek justice in an unjust world.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2014-2015","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy","Supernatural","Magic","Ecchi"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/284131/hdtvlogo/the-seven-deadly-sins-5f557b09006da.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/8699/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/284131/showbackground/the-seven-deadly-sins-5f557d309e785.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"wxcvbL6o55M","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/nanatsu-no-taizai"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Ecchi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Ecchi"}]},{"id":"kitsu:42586","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Ressha-hen","aliases":["Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train","Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Ressha-hen","Gekijouban Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Ressha-hen","Kimetsu no Yaiba: Infinity Train"],"description":"Falling forever into an endless dream...

Placing their lives in each other’s hands, the two of them must continue to fight off the increasingly mounting demonic menace, discover its source, and hopefully complete Rosette’s own personal mission of finding her missing brother, Joshua.","releaseInfo":"2003-2004","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.6","genres":["Supernatural","Historical","Demons","Romance","Action"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/73993/hdtvlogo/chrono-crusade-51a0c559890b8.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/41/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/73993/showbackground/chrono-crusade-5fb459e859c88.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"BRLC0zVfjL0","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.6","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/chrno-crusade"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Demons","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Demons"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"}]},{"id":"kitsu:46689","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Higeki no Genkyou to Naru Saikyou Gedou Last Boss Joou wa Tami no Tame ni Tsukushimasu.","aliases":["The Most Heretical Last Boss Queen: From Villainess to Savior","Higeki no Genkyou to Naru Saikyou Gedou Last Boss Joou wa Tami no Tame ni Tsukushimasu.","LasTame"],"description":"Pride Royal Ivy is only eight years old when she realizes that she’s been reincarnated, destined to become the future wicked queen and final boss of an otome game.

An \"infection\" in the past caused the automated systems to spiral out of order, resulting in a multi-leveled city structure that replicates itself infinitely in all directions. Now humanity has lost access to the city's controls, and is hunted down and purged by the defense system known as the Safeguard. In a tiny corner of the city, a little enclave known as the Electro-Fishers is facing eventual extinction, trapped between the threat of the Safeguard and dwindling food supplies. A girl named Zuru goes on a journey to find food for her village, only to inadvertently cause doom when an observation tower senses her and summons a Safeguard pack to eliminate the threat. With her companions dead and all escape routes blocked, the only thing that can save her now is the sudden arrival of Killy the Wanderer, on his quest for the Net Terminal Genes, the key to restoring order to the world.\n\n(Source: Official site)","releaseInfo":"2017","runtime":"110 min","imdbRating":"7.1","genres":["Action","Drama","Mecha","Psychological","Sci-Fi"],"logo":null,"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/11537/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt6574146/img","trailers":[{"source":"_k75jXSruSs","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/blame-movie"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Mecha","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mecha"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"}]},{"id":"kitsu:45247","type":"series","animeType":"ONA","name":"Ame wo Tsugeru Hyouryuu Danchi","aliases":["Drifting Home","Ame wo Tsugeru Hyouryuu Danchi"],"description":"One summer day, Kosuke &amp; Natsume are at an old housing complex which gets teardown soon.

This might not seem like an ability that could exert power over a land, but in Manyuu Hikenchou, large breasts denote status, wealth, fame, and influence.\nGrave concern has arisen in the Manyuu clan due to the actions of their chosen successor, Chifusa. Disgusted with the breast obsessed society that the Manyuu have created and perpetuated, Chifusa has not only deserted the clan, but also stolen the sacred scroll that details their techniques to growing and severing breasts.\nFortunately, Chifusa is not completely alone. Her fellow warrior Kaede is sympathetic to her cause; a sympathy that could place her in considerable danger. Now wanted by the very clan that raised her, Chifusa must defend her life and Kaede’s while seeking to undo the damage their brethren have done to the land.

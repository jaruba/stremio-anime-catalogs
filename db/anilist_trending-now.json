[{"id":"kitsu:12","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"One Piece","aliases":["One Piece","ワンピース"],"description":"Gol D. Roger was known as the \"Pirate King,\" the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and death of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King.\nEnter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy’s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"1999-","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.3","genres":["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Fantasy","Super Power","Drama","Friendship"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/81797/hdtvlogo/one-piece-50634857c8263.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/12/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/81797/showbackground/one-piece-55225fb102498.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"CmTeYj2FmRc","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/one-piece"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Friendship","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Friendship"}]},{"id":"kitsu:49277","kitsu_id":"49277","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Kowloon Generic Romance","aliases":["Kowloon Generic Romance","九龍GR"],"description":"Real estate agents Reiko Kujirai and Hajime Kudo work in the nostalgic Kowloon Walled City.

Unusually for an anime, a narrator reads Kenji's story aloud while the action is played out on the screen by a succession of warm and evocative illustrations brought to life by subtle touches of animation. If the film feels somehow familiar yet you can't put your finger on the reason why, it's probably the sumptuously minimalist animation by Yasuhiro Nagura, who was the animation director of Mamoru Oshii's artsy 1986 feature Angel's Egg. That, and Kenji's wildcat is said to have been the inspiration for Miyazaki's Panda/Totoro creature. The idea of reading Kenji's story aloud instead of playing it out as a drama is quite refreshing, and Kenji's magical language and narrative style are entirely sufficient to sustain interest. Combined with the spacey music and breathtaking art, the result is a pleasantly unassuming little gem of a film.","releaseInfo":"1988","runtime":"25 min","genres":["Drama"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/5341/medium.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"}]},{"id":"kitsu:42909","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Enen no Shouboutai: Ni no Shou","aliases":["Fire Force Season 2","Enen no Shouboutai: Ni no Shou","Enen no Shouboutai 2nd Season"],"description":"The Fire Force seeks out the next Pillar and protects humanity from another Great Cataclysm from occurring!(Source: Crunchyroll)","releaseInfo":"2020","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"8.0","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/355480/hdtvlogo/fire-force-5d29f88e40bf9.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/42909/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/355480/showbackground/fire-force-6225f6a5be71a.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"0qBa70CeVfM","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.0","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/enen-no-shouboutai-ni-no-shou"}]},{"id":"kitsu:47271","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"WIND BREAKER","aliases":["WIND BREAKER"],"description":"Welcome to Furin High School, an institution infamous for its population of brawny brutes who solve every conflict with a show of strength.

What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2013","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.5","genres":["Mystery","Super Power","Military","Fantasy","Drama","Action"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/267440/hdtvlogo/attack-on-titan-51a64c2cb7247.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/7442/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/267440/showbackground/attack-on-titan-551eb271053e8.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"LHtdKWJdif4","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/attack-on-titan"},{"name":"Mystery","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mystery"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"}]},{"id":"kitsu:42765","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Jujutsu Kaisen","aliases":["Jujutsu Kaisen","Sorcery Fight"],"description":"Yuji Itadori is a boy with tremendous physical strength, though he lives a completely ordinary high school life.

To make matters worse, Sword Art Online is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life. Kirito must adapt to his new reality, fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2012","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.3","genres":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy","Game","Romance"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/259640/hdtvlogo/sword-art-online-53b9a74a90195.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/6589/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/259640/showbackground/sword-art-online-53db475d1eada.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"6ohYYtxfDCg","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/sword-art-online"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Game","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Game"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"}]},{"id":"kitsu:10028","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Koe no Katachi","aliases":["A Silent Voice","Koe no Katachi","The Shape of Voice","A Silent Voice: The Movie"],"description":"Shoya is a bully.

With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2012-2013","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Action","Sci-Fi","Police","Psychological"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/262090/hdtvlogo/psycho-pass-51f83338cf2de.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/7000/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/262090/showbackground/psycho-pass-53db3233c7256.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"70zW21l5ZUU","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/psycho-pass"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Police","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Police"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"}]},{"id":"kitsu:44081","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Kimetsu no Yaiba: Yuukaku-hen","aliases":["Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Entertainment District Arc","Kimetsu no Yaiba: Yuukaku-hen","Kimetsu no Yaiba 2","Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Season 2","Demon Slayer 2","Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Yuukaku-hen"],"description":"After visiting the Rengoku residence, Tanjirou and his comrades volunteer for a mission within the Entertainment District, a place where desires are sold and demons dwell.

But unbeknownst to them, a much darker force stalks the pair from the shadows, and just minutes after locating the insignia, Subaru and Satella are brutally murdered.\n\nHowever, Subaru immediately reawakens to a familiar scene—confronted by the same group of thugs, meeting Satella all over again—the enigma deepens as history inexplicably repeats itself.","releaseInfo":"2016","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Psychological","Thriller","Fantasy","Drama"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/305089/hdtvlogo/re-life-in-a-different-world-from-zero-5c557104dfd17.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/11209/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/305089/showbackground/re-life-in-a-different-world-from-zero-604b5e5804700.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"IvhgOe9BY5A","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/re-zero-kara-hajimeru-isekai-seikatsu"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"},{"name":"Thriller","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Thriller"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"}]},{"id":"kitsu:12268","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Boku no Hero Academia 2","aliases":["My Hero Academia 2","Boku no Hero Academia 2"],"description":"Taking off right after the last episode of the first season.

With their school set as the first point of attack, Tanukichi will have to do the unthinkable when he realizes that their primary target is the person he admires most.\n\n(Source: MAL)","releaseInfo":"2015","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.3","genres":["Comedy","School","Ecchi"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/293774/hdtvlogo/shimoneta-a-boring-world-where-the-concept-of-dirty-jokes-do-62459af21d2c1.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/10352/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/293774/showbackground/shimoneta-a-boring-world-where-the-concept-of-dirty-jokes-do-62459b265d94d.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"k4sLMxdbnSo","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/shimoneta-to-iu-gainen-ga-sonzai-shinai-taikutsu-na-sekai"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Ecchi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Ecchi"}]},{"id":"kitsu:44241","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Vanitas no Carte","aliases":["The Case Study of Vanitas","Vanitas no Carte","Vanitas no Shuki","Memoir of Vanitas"],"description":"It’s 19th-century Paris, and young vampire Noé hunts for the Book of Vanitas.

But if they fail, they face the consequence of participating in a devastating war that will engulf both sides of the gate.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2015","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"7.7","genres":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy","Military"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/295222/hdtvlogo/gate-55e56596c9147.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/10085/poster_image/medium-563d50a7607bfebd46100f94d932da85.jpeg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/295222/showbackground/gate-603be033ced04.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"mWi2mYklRl4","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.7","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/gate-jieitai-kanochi-nite-kaku-tatakaeri"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7705","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!

With Kagura and Shinpachi at his side, he sets off to get the device fixed; though, as usual, nothing is ever that simple for the Yorozuya team.\nFilled with tongue-in-cheek humor and moments of heartfelt emotion, Gintama's fourth season finds Gintoki and his friends facing both their most hilarious misadventures and most dangerous crises yet.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2015-2016","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Action","Comedy","Historical","Parody","Samurai","Sci-Fi"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79895/hdtvlogo/gintama-5c75b5152ff67.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/10083/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79895/showbackground/gintama-606b79565fb78.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"W_eWXh85VS4","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/gintama-2015-tv"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Parody","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Parody"},{"name":"Samurai","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Samurai"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"}]},{"id":"kitsu:42611","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou 2","aliases":["Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2","Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou 2","Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest 2","From Common Job Class to the Strongest in the World 2nd Season","Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou 2nd Season"],"description":"Transported to another world and left behind by his former friends, Hajime had to make his rise from literal rock bottom.

Now, Saitama is incredibly powerful, so much so that no enemy is able to defeat him in battle. In fact, all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite bored.\n\nThis all changes with the arrival of Genos, a 19-year-old cyborg, who wishes to be Saitama's disciple after seeing what he is capable of. Genos proposes that the two join the Hero Association in order to become certified heroes that will be recognized for their positive contributions to society, and Saitama, shocked that no one knows who he is, quickly agrees. And thus begins the story of One Punch Man, an action-comedy that follows an eccentric individual who longs to fight strong enemies that can hopefully give him the excitement he once felt and just maybe, he'll become popular in the process.","releaseInfo":"2015","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.4","genres":["Comedy","Sci-Fi","Supernatural","Super Power","Parody","Action"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/293088/hdtvlogo/one-punch-man-55fd2d46f35d1.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/10740/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/293088/showbackground/one-punch-man-568ba6a86e003.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"tMblzsXwAKo","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/one-punch-man"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"},{"name":"Parody","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Parody"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"}]},{"id":"kitsu:46970","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Suki na Ko ga Megane wo Wasureta","aliases":["The Girl I Like Forgot Her Glasses","Suki na Ko ga Megane wo Wasureta","Sukinako ga Megane wo Wasureta","สาวลืมแว่นแสนวุ่นละมุนรัก","Cô bạn tôi thầm thích lại quên mang kính rồi"],"description":"With the new school year comes a new homeroom, new classmates, and a new desk for the timid Komura.

Who could have imagined the dangers that would soon follow this lighthearted event?\nMaking a wish on the Black Star Dragon Balls causes the planet they are used on to explode exactly one year after the wish has been granted. And the Black Star Dragon Balls do not simply scatter across the Earth, they scatter across the entire galaxy. It is up to Gokuu, Trunks, and Pan to retrieve the Balls and save the Earth, but they will find many enemies who are a far greater threat than Emperor Pilaf on their journey throughout the galaxy.","releaseInfo":"1996-1997","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"6.3","genres":["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Fantasy","Magic","Sci-Fi","Super Power"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79275/hdtvlogo/dragon-ball-gt-53ee8f56853d8.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/200/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79275/showbackground/dragon-ball-gt-5e888db3306b1.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"b5mKTXse_gQ","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"6.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/dragon-ball-gt"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"}]},{"id":"kitsu:13268","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Owarimonogatari 2nd Season","aliases":["Owarimonogatari Second Season","Owarimonogatari 2nd Season","Owarimonogatari (2017)","End Story 2nd Season"],"description":"Second season of Owarimonogatari.","releaseInfo":"2017","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Vampire","Supernatural","Mystery","Comedy"],"logo":null,"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/13268/medium.jpg","background":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/cover_images/13268/original.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"7WdyIcDlK2o","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/owarimonogatari-2nd-season"},{"name":"Vampire","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Vampire"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Mystery","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mystery"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"}]},{"id":"kitsu:42922","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Kemono Jihen","aliases":["Kemono Jihen","けものじへん","Monster Incidents","Kemono Incidents"],"description":"When a series of animal bodies that rot away after a single night begin appearing in a remote mountain village, Inugami, a detective from Tokyo who specializes in the occult, is called to investigate.\n\nWhile working the case, he befriends a strange boy who works in the field every day instead of going to school.

He also quickly learns he must stay on his toes once he meets the rest of his colleagues, including the katana-wielding floor chief Yachiyo Todoroki, the intimidating head chef Jun Satou, the dangerously well-informed and subtly sadistic sous chef Hiroomi Souma, the adamantly lazy manager Kyouko Shirafuji, and the waitress Mahiru Inami who has a \"painful\" fear of men.\nPowered by an eccentric cast, Working!! is a unique workplace comedy that follows the never-dull happenings within the walls of Wagnaria as Takanashi and his co-workers' quirky personalities combine to create non-stop antics, shenanigans, and hilarity.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2010","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.7","genres":["Comedy","Slice of Life","Romance","Workplace"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/145211/hdtvlogo/working-5cd50d60171a0.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/4805/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/145211/showbackground/working-621b53644f518.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.7","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/working-1"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"Workplace","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Workplace"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7910","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Space☆Dandy","aliases":["Space Dandy","Space☆Dandy"],"description":"The universe is a mysterious and strange place, full of even stranger and more mysterious aliens. Dandy's job is to hunt down unclassified aliens and register them for a reward. It sounds easy enough, but something weird always seems to happen along the way, like chance meetings with zombies, mystical ramen chefs, and adorable orphans. Hunting down aliens may not be easy, but it's definitely never boring.\nWith the help of his sidekicks, the adorable robot vacuum QT and cat-like alien Meow, and his slightly-used ship the Aloha Oe, Dandy roams the galaxy searching for new alien species. What he usually finds, however, is adventure, danger, and romance, and no two journeys (or universes) are ever the same.

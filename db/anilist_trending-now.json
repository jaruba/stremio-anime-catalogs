Kaiman, more reptile than man, is one such individual. He hunts them on a heedless quest for answers with only a trusted pair of bayonets and his immunity to magic. Cursed by his appearance and tormented by nightmares, magic users are his only clue to restoring his life to normal. With his biggest obstacle being his stomach, his female companion Nikaidou, who runs the restaurant Hungry Bug, is his greatest ally.\n\nSet in a gritty world of hellish design, Dorohedoro manages a healthy blend of comedy and lightheartedness with death and carnage. Taking plenty of twists and turns while following the lives of Hole's residents, it weaves a unique world of unearthly origin and dreary appearance not for the squeamish or easily disturbed.","releaseInfo":"2020","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.0","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/370761/hdtvlogo/dorohedoro--5f2f715778052.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/42040/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/370761/showbackground/dorohedoro--600c47992d5c6.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"8yrNYhhZKqQ","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.0","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/dorohedoro"}]},{"id":"kitsu:220","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Great Teacher Onizuka","aliases":["Great Teacher Onizuka","GTO"],"description":"Onizuka is a reformed biker gang leader who has his sights set on an honorable new ambition: to become the world's greatest teacher... for the purpose of meeting sexy high school girls.

Dissatisfied with their slow advance into the Demon Realm, the Hero abandons his companions to quickly forge ahead towards the Demon Queen's castle. Upon his arrival at the royal abode, the Hero makes a startling discovery: not only is the Demon Queen a woman of unparalleled beauty, but she also seeks the Hero's help. Confused by this unexpected turn of events, the Hero refuses to ally himself with his enemy, claiming that the war the demons have waged is tearing the Southern Nations apart.\nHowever, the Demon Queen rebuts, arguing that the war has not only united humanity but has also brought them wealth and prosperity, providing evidence to support her claims. Furthermore, she explains that if the war were to end, the supplies sent by the Central Nations in aid to the Southern Nations would cease, leaving hundreds of thousands to starve. Fortunately, she offers the Hero a way to end the war while bringing hope not only to the Southern Nations, but also to the rest of the world, though she will need his assistance to make this a reality.\nFinally convinced, the Hero agrees to join his now former enemy in her quest. Vowing to stay together through sickness and health, they set off for the human world.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2013","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.3","genres":["Adventure","Fantasy","Romance","Historical","Demons"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/264056/hdtvlogo/maoyu-5c75b4204e927.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/7174/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/264056/showbackground/maoyu-613b22db90c50.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"8_sC28gQYFs","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/maoyu"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Demons","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Demons"}]},{"id":"kitsu:46299","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu","aliases":["The Dangers in My Heart","Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu"],"description":"Fascinated by murder and all things macabre, Kyoutarou daydreams of acting out his twisted fantasies on his unsuspecting classmates — but an encounter with Anna Yamada, the gorgeous class idol, lights a spark in the darkness of his heart.

Hoping to repay her debt to the trio someday, Shirayuki sets her sights on pursuing a career as the court herbalist in Zen's country, Clarines.\n\nAkagami no Shirayuki-hime depicts Shirayuki's journey toward a new life at the royal palace of Clarines, as well as Zen's endeavor to become a prince worthy of his title. As loyal friendships are forged and deadly enemies formed, Shirayuki and Zen slowly learn to support each other as they walk their own paths.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2015","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":["Drama","Fantasy","Romance"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/295205/hdtvlogo/snow-white-with-the-red-hair-5c556c9a2061b.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/10621/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/295205/showbackground/snow-white-with-the-red-hair-62823e44b2232.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"XzXLibJm6GE","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/akagami-no-shirayuki-hime"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"}]},{"id":"kitsu:2624","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Gake no Ue no Ponyo","aliases":["Ponyo","Gake no Ue no Ponyo","Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea"],"description":"A lonely little boy named Sousuke lives with his mother by the sea, flashing messages across the water to his father's boat.

Confused by this unexpected turn of events, the Hero refuses to ally himself with his enemy, claiming that the war the demons have waged is tearing the Southern Nations apart.\nHowever, the Demon Queen rebuts, arguing that the war has not only united humanity but has also brought them wealth and prosperity, providing evidence to support her claims. Furthermore, she explains that if the war were to end, the supplies sent by the Central Nations in aid to the Southern Nations would cease, leaving hundreds of thousands to starve. Fortunately, she offers the Hero a way to end the war while bringing hope not only to the Southern Nations, but also to the rest of the world, though she will need his assistance to make this a reality.\nFinally convinced, the Hero agrees to join his now former enemy in her quest.

With their school set as the first point of attack, Tanukichi will have to do the unthinkable when he realizes that their primary target is the person he admires most.\n\n(Source: MAL)","releaseInfo":"2015","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.3","genres":["Comedy","Ecchi","School"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/293774/hdtvlogo/shimoneta-a-boring-world-where-the-concept-of-dirty-jokes-do-62459af21d2c1.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/10352/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/293774/showbackground/shimoneta-a-boring-world-where-the-concept-of-dirty-jokes-do-62459b265d94d.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"k4sLMxdbnSo","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/shimoneta-to-iu-gainen-ga-sonzai-shinai-taikutsu-na-sekai"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Ecchi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Ecchi"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"}]},{"id":"kitsu:6711","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Wolf Children","aliases":["Wolf Children","Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki","The Wolf Children Ame and Yuki"],"description":"Hana, a hard-working college student, falls in love with a mysterious man who attends one of her classes though he is not an actual student.

However, before Yuuji can learn anything more about his situation, he discovers that he has already been reduced to a Torch—merely a scrap of memory waiting to be extinguished.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2005-2006","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.4","genres":["Action","Fantasy","Romance","School","Supernatural","Drama"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/78962/hdtvlogo/shakugan-no-shana-56d98ebb29d98.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/322/poster_image/medium-2da41d49a879995c05597681ffe89b92.jpeg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/78962/showbackground/shakugan-no-shana-56d992182efd8.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"9C2nhALMzrk","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.4","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/shakugan-no-shana"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"}]},{"id":"kitsu:4863","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou","aliases":["Demon King Daimao","Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou","Ichiban Ushiro no Dai Mao"],"description":"Dreaming of changing the world for good, Akuto Sai transfers to Constant Magic Academy where he befriends a virtuous ninja clan member, Junko Hattori.

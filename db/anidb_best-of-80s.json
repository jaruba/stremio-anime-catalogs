However, when he meets an unusual girl called Misuzu, he is reminded of what his mother once told him—\"When you go out on your journey, if you find the winged girl's re-incarnation, you must use your power to set her free.\"\nYukito and Misuzu's fates soon become intertwined with each other, with each developing feelings for the other. However when Yukito realizes Misuzu's connection to the past, he must decide on whether to leave, or to attempt to break the curse that has bound Kanna in centuries of pain.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2005","runtime":"91 min","imdbRating":"7.0","genres":["Supernatural","Drama","Romance"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/80/medium.jpg","background":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/cover_images/80/original.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.0","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/air-movie"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7757","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Fushigiboshi no☆Futagohime","aliases":["Fushigiboshi no☆Futagohime","Fushigi-boshi no Futago-hime","Fushigi Boshi no Futago Hime","Twin Princesses of the Wonder Planet","Twin Princesses of the Mysterious Star","Twin Princess of the Mysterious Planet"],"description":"In the hollow Mysterious Planet, seven kingdoms co-exist, all of them lit by the Sun's Blessing from the Kingdom of the Sun, in the middle of the planet.

After a short fight with the smoking, bad-tempered rabbit, Usahara, Uruno decides that he wants to move on... but changes his mind upon meeting Chiiko, a clumsy cheetah girl. It's love at first sight for Uruno, and after deciding to stay for her, he continues to hope that even though he's a good-for-nothing, he'll win her over someday. That is, if living with the other strange residents of the forest-- including the aformentioned smoking rabbit, a sake-drinking unicorn, a near-sighted eagle, an orca that cannot swim, and a shy pegasus --doesn't get to him first.","releaseInfo":"2005","imdbRating":"6.8","genres":["Comedy","Slice of Life"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/446/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt0907604/img","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"6.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/damekko-doubutsu"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"}]},{"id":"kitsu:44421","kitsu_id":"44421","imdb_id":"tt35652414","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Uta no☆Prince-sama♪ Movie: Maji Love ST☆RISH Tours","aliases":["Uta no☆Prince-sama♪ Movie: Maji Love ST☆RISH Tours","Uta no Prince-sama Maji Love Starish Tours Movie","UtaPri Movie 2","Gekijouban Uta no Prince-sama: Maji Love Starish Tours"],"description":"The film — described as part of a \"new theatrical film series\" — will be entirely composed of concert footage of the ST☆RISH idol group.","releaseInfo":"2022","genres":[],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/44421/poster_image/medium-440114fe91ee41809749684e78596ff7.jpeg","trailers":[{"source":"tlkzvB_NT1s","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[]},{"id":"kitsu:49660","kitsu_id":"49660","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Mumei no Jinsei","aliases":["Mumei no Jinsei","A lonely bullied boy who follows in his father's footsteps and aims to become an idol."],"releaseInfo":"2025","genres":[],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/49660/poster_image/medium-d284d144a9209c8f15343f24fdc4ceb4.jpeg","trailers":[],"links":[]},{"id":"kitsu:49069","kitsu_id":"49069","type":"series","animeType":"ONA","name":"Lycoris Recoil: Friends are thieves of time.","aliases":["Lycoris Recoil -Friends are thieves of time.-","Lycoris Recoil: Friends are thieves of time.","Lycoris Recoil Short Movie Friends are thieves of time.","リコリス・リコイル ショートムービー Friends are thieves of time.","LycoReco Shorts","リコリコ ショートムービー"],"description":"Six short movies featuring the daily lives of Chisato, Takina, and their friends.

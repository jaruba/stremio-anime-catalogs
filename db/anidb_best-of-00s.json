They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward loses his left leg, Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called \"automail\" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist.\n\nThree years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher's Stone, but their country's murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2009-2010","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.3","genres":["Action","Adventure","Drama","Fantasy","Magic","Military","Comedy"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/85249/hdtvlogo/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood-51e2acc9b4536.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/3936/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/85249/showbackground/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood-5ea09a0907f31.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"yb2R1l0O9Zs","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"}]},{"id":"kitsu:2916","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Aria The Origination","aliases":["Aria The Origination","Aria Season 3"],"description":"As winter melts into spring, Akari, Aika and Alice continue to work hard to become Neo-Venezia's top gondoliers.

On the streets of Okinawa, he uses nothing but his wits and a \"fastball\" peaking at a mere 134 kmph to somehow achieve 499 wins in the game of \"One Outs,\" a simplified version of baseball between the pitcher and one batter. Amazed by Toua's unique prowess on the mound, veteran slugger Kojima Hiromichi artfully scouts the pitcher for his long unsuccessful team, the Saikyou Saitama Lycaons. Kojima desperately hopes Toua will lead them to the championship; however, Tsuneo Saikawa, the mercenary owner of the Lycaons, sees the vastly talented pitcher as a threat to the income generated by the team. Rising to the challenge of swaying the owner, Toua suggests a one-of-a-kind \"One Outs\" contract: every out Toua pitches will earn him five million yen, but with every run he gives up, he will lose fifty million yen.\nAdapted from the manga by Shinobu Kaitani of Liar Game fame, One Outs documents the intense psychological battles between Toua and those around him. With millions of yen at stake, can a pitcher who has done nothing but gamble in a head-to-head imitation of baseball finally lead a real baseball team to victory?\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2008-2009","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":["Sports","Psychological"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/84616/hdtvlogo/one-outs-5c7e082d4f3d3.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/3899/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt1411815/img","trailers":[{"source":"frCs_tLwelw","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/one-outs"},{"name":"Sports","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sports"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"}]},{"id":"kitsu:4095","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Kemono no Souja Erin","aliases":["Erin","Kemono no Souja Erin","Kemono no Soujya Erin","Kemono no Sou-ja Erin","The Beast Player Erin"],"description":"Erin is a young girl who lives with her mother in a village which raises war-lizards, called Touda.

Relying solely on his vehicle's speed, JP prepares for the event to come, aiming to take first place in the biggest race of his life.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2009","runtime":"102 min","imdbRating":"8.1","genres":["Sci-Fi","Sports","Racing","Action","Cars"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/71883/hdmovielogo/redline-51fe761a664a8.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/4659/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/71883/moviebackground/redline-58228c6cae08b.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"RB-2Hjj_eEg","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/redline"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Sports","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sports"},{"name":"Racing","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Racing"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Cars","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Cars"}]},{"id":"kitsu:2","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door","aliases":["Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door","Cowboy Bebop: The Movie","Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira"],"description":"Another day, another bounty—such is the life of the often unlucky crew of the Bebop.

If those secrets should fall into the wrong hands, it could mean big trouble. And big trouble there is. A Martian splinter group has launched an offensive, leaving the United Forces befuddled and desperate. So much so, in fact, that the former crew of the Nadesico is called back to active duty for a special unsanctioned mission-to save us all. Does this menagerie of misfits have what it takes? Who will win the race for the Boson technology? And what the heck happened to Akito and Yurika?","releaseInfo":"1998","runtime":"79 min","imdbRating":"6.6","genres":["Action","Comedy","Drama","Mecha","Sci-Fi","Space","Psychological"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/36613/hdmovielogo/martian-successor-nadesico-the-motion-picture---prince-of-da-563778a443928.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/195/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/movies/36613/moviebackground/martian-successor-nadesico-the-motion-picture---prince-of-da-563779284813e.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"6.6","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/kidou-senkan-nadesico-the-prince-of-darkness"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Mecha","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mecha"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Space","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Space"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"}]},{"id":"kitsu:1094","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Seikimatsu★Darling","aliases":["Seikimatsu★Darling","Seikimatsu Darling","End of Century - Darling"],"description":"Ogata, a nice and hardworking man, has only one problem...

The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys). Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas. The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series. They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world, owned by the king of Marinera, the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself. The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world`s entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack (`Bishounen-Killer`) Bancoran. Bancoran`s nickname doesn`t mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This, to Bancoran`s eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour`s flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran`s palatial condo in the suburbs of same.

The twist is that Sunred (referred to most characters familiar with him as Red-san) is a rough-talking, violent and rude hero while the villains of Florsheim (led by General Vamp) are for the most part polite, conscientious and easy-going.\nDespite this, both sides still stay true to their roles, with Florsheim dedicated to destroying Sunred and taking over the world while Sunred battles against them. Other evil organisations and heroes also appear from time to time.\nEach episode is divided into various shorts of varying length.

Despondent and aimless, he falls into a cycle of self abuse, depression and drugs that taints his life for years. Told in four chapters, each chapter deals with a different point in his life and the final chapter leaves him standing alone - an empty and hollow caricature of his former self.\n\nIn the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita) - A love story between a 12th-century woman and a mountain bandit who abducts her.\n\nKokoro - A 1914 tale of a young man's life journey during the Meiji era. The work deals with the transition from the Japanese Meiji society to the modern era, by exploring the friendship between a young man and an older man he calls \"Sensei\". It continues the theme of isolation developed in Soseki's previous works, here in the context of interwoven strands of egoism and guilt, as opposed to shame.\n\nRun, Melos! (Hashire, Melos!) - An updated retelling of a classic Greek tale of the story of Damon and Pythias. The most prominent theme of \"Run, Melos!\" is unwavering friendship. Despite facing hardships, the protagonist Melos does his best to save his friend's life, and in the end his efforts are rewarded.\n\nThe Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito) - The Buddha Shakyamuni chances to notice a cold-hearted criminal suffering in Hell. But this criminal did perform one single act of kindness in not stepping on a spider in a forest. Moved by this selfless act, Shakyamuni takes the silvery thread of a spider in Paradise and lowers it down into Hell, but it falls upon the criminal to seize the opportunity and pull himself out - if he can.\n\nHell Screen (Jigoku Hen) - A famous artist is commissioned by a great lord to create a series of paintings depicting scenes of the \"Buddhist Hell.\" The artist is unable to paint scenes that he has not seen himself, prompting him to torture and torment the Lord's staff to create his imagined images of hell. His creative efforts taint the household, as the story descends into madness and destruction.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","releaseInfo":"2009","runtime":"22 min","imdbRating":"7.6","genres":["Drama","Historical","Psychological","Thriller"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/119781/hdtvlogo/aoi-bungaku-51785d48c6241.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/4900/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/119781/showbackground/aoi-bungaku-5f838857ec9bb.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"sLPeStRHsDU","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.6","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/aoi-bungaku-series"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"},{"name":"Thriller","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Thriller"}]},{"id":"kitsu:2543","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Shakugan no Shana II (Second)","aliases":["Shakugan no Shana: Season II","Shakugan no Shana II (Second)","Shakugan no Shana 2"],"description":"The heated bond between Shana and Yuji is tested as their paranormal adventures continue.

The coming battle will test Daisaku's resolve to the utmost, reveal the ghastly truth behind the creation of the Shizuma Drive, and bring human civilization to its knees!\nGiant Robo is a character-driven adventure in a retro-futuristic setting, drawing on influences from opera, kung-fu cinema, wuxia stories and classic mecha anime. It incorporates characters from the works of the manga author Mitsuteru Yokoyama but it is designed to be a stand-alone story.","releaseInfo":"1992-1998","runtime":"49 min","imdbRating":"7.8","genres":["Action","Mecha","Sci-Fi","Super Power","Drama"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/2102/medium.jpg","background":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/cover_images/2102/original.png","trailers":[{"source":"sxRJY-xTRo0","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/giant-robo-the-animation-chikyuu-ga-seishi-suru-hi"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Mecha","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mecha"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"}]},{"id":"kitsu:4634","kitsu_id":"4634","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Ibara no Ou","aliases":["King of Thorn","Ibara no Ou","Ibara no Oh"],"description":"\"Medusa,\" a deadly virus becomes a worldwide epidemic.

However, Kaname intervenes with the council's decision with not only the intention of saving Zero but with another purpose unbeknown to everyone around him.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2008","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.1","genres":["Mystery","Drama","Vampire","Supernatural","Romance"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/81816/hdtvlogo/vampire-knight-5ce6928935f17.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/3023/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt1209393/img","trailers":[{"source":"1OLs8BUHMGk","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.1","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/vampire-knight-guilty"},{"name":"Mystery","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mystery"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Vampire","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Vampire"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"}]},{"id":"kitsu:1558","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Muteki Kanban Musume","aliases":["Ramen Fighter Miki","Muteki Kanban Musume","Noodle Fighter Miki"],"description":"Miki Onimaru is a poster girl that works at her mother's Chinese ramen restaurant.

In the 1920’s, monstrous demons began appearing in surprisingly high numbers across America, manifesting as sin incarnate. To combat this menace, a holy organization known as the Order of Magdalene established branches across the country, all governed by the Council of the Catholic Church.\nThe New York branch is home to the young and reckless Sister Rosette Christopher and her demon hunting partner, Chrno. Armed to the teeth with holy guns and bullets, the two are renowned for accomplishing their job, but also causing extensive property damage at the same time. This doesn’t exactly please the head of their branch, Sister Kate Valentine, though Rosette is still greatly appreciated by the branch’s minister, Father Ewan Remington, and their weapon developer, Edward Hamilton.\nChrno, however, leaves them with a sense of unease; there’s more to him than there appears to be, and even more behind the bond that he and Rosette share. Placing their lives in each other’s hands, the two of them must continue to fight off the increasingly mounting demonic menace, discover its source, and hopefully complete Rosette’s own personal mission of finding her missing brother, Joshua.","releaseInfo":"2003-2004","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"7.6","genres":["Supernatural","Historical","Demons","Romance","Action"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/73993/hdtvlogo/chrono-crusade-51a0c559890b8.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/41/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/73993/showbackground/chrono-crusade-5fb459e859c88.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"BRLC0zVfjL0","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.6","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/chrno-crusade"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Demons","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Demons"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"}]},{"id":"kitsu:821","type":"series","animeType":"OVA","name":"Nurse Witch Komugi-chan Magikarte Z","aliases":["Nurse Witch Komugi-chan Magikarte Z"],"description":"Sequel to the first series.","releaseInfo":"2004-2005","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"6.7","genres":["Comedy","Magic","Parody"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/821/medium.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"6.7","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/nurse-witch-komugi-chan-magikarte-z"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Parody","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Parody"}]},{"id":"kitsu:2506","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Vexille: 2077 Nihon Sakoku","aliases":["Vexille","Vexille: 2077 Nihon Sakoku","Vexille: 2077 Nippon Sakoku","Vexille: 2077 Japan National Isolation"],"description":"In an alternate 21st century, the robotics industry undergoes a period of rapid advancement worldwide. By the year 2050, Japan has firmly established itself as the leader in robotic technology and manufacture with Daiwa Heavy Industries. As the technology evolves to include robotic enhancements to the human body, the blurring of the line between man and machine triggers a sudden shift in world opinion. In response, the U.N. passes a unilateral ban of further research and development on robotics in 2067. Japan fiercely objects to this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage. In protest, Japan withdrew from international politics and chose to pursue a policy of high-tech national isolation. While only trade continues, Japan disappears from the world scene.\n\nTen years later, a series of bizarre incidents lead the American technology police agency SWORD to believe that Japan has concealed extensive development of banned technologies through the use of the RACE network. SWORD dispatches a unit of special agents to infiltrate Japan and gather intelligence on the country. Vexille, a veteran agent among the group, uncovers the horrifying truth behind the ten years of isolation.","releaseInfo":"2007","runtime":"110 min","imdbRating":"6.8","genres":["Sci-Fi","Military","Action"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/2506/medium.jpg","background":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/cover_images/2506/original.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"6.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/vexille-2077-nihon-sakoku"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"}]},{"id":"kitsu:1096","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Chocotto Sister","aliases":["Chocotto Sister","Chokotto Sister"],"description":"Haruma Kawagoe is an only child.

Alien invaders known as the Neuroi came to Earth in 1939. This is not the first appearance of the Neuroi as they have appeared at seemingly random intervals throughout human history. While the Neuroi primarily attack humanity using aircrafts, their mothership is able to produce a deadly miasma, a chemical that is fatally poisonous to humans, forcing the populations of affected areas to flee their homes. The Neuroi then use the poisoned areas to plunder Earth's natural resources to use against humanity. Luckily the miasma cannot spread across water, making the ocean humanity's main line of defense against the Neuroi.\nWith normal humans unable to fight in the miasma, witches have become the forefront of military defense against the Neuroi. Each witch is able to deploy a defensive field around themselves that not only blocks the miasma but protects them from physical attacks as well. Utilizing leg mounted machines called Striker Units to fly into combat, the witches use their magical abilities to wield devastating weapons too large and ungainly for a normal person. The series follows the battles fought by the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, who battle on the front lines to defend the British Isles from the Neuroi. Will humanity be able to take back Earth and bring peace to their home?

Soon after, he also adopts a stray cat named Zubu (or wet in Japanese, due to the discovery of it in a rainstorm)... and many other stray cats and dogs. With so many stray cats and dogs, Nobita, along with his friends, decide to send them back in time, 300 million years ago, where there was no other living beings around. After using the Ray of Evolution to allow them to operate a food-making machine, they depart, with a promise to return to the present.\nHowever, when they try to visit them the next day (from their point of view), they encountered a time-space anomaly, sending them crash landing 1,000 years before their original time-destination— to their surprise, They found out the dogs and cats have evolved enough to form a civilized society that rivaled those of Future Society.

It turns out Ryoko sent this girl, along with her older brother Mikihiro, to live at the Ninomiya household.\nBut the newly-arrived siblings are a little special: Mayu is, in fact, a succubus and her brother, an incubus! And as if the circumstances are not problematic enough, Mayu is crippled with androphobia—the fear of men—and it's up to Shungo to help her overcome this at the behest of his sister. Ryoko plans to force Mayu to be closer to Shungo, and to do this, she’ll employ some questionable methods such as having them share the same bed and even take baths together. \nThe situation further complicates when student council president Reika Houjou arrives as the new maid of the Ninomiya family, and she will stop at nothing to thwart Shungo and Mayu’s sexually-geared training. With the sudden arrival of all these oddities, Shungo's ordinary life is about to be thrown into utter turmoil.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2007","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"6.5","genres":["Comedy","Harem","Fantasy","Ecchi"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/82167/hdtvlogo/goshuushou-sama-ninomiya-kun-6078c7e6ec2cf.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/2264/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/82167/showbackground/goshuushou-sama-ninomiya-kun-6078c9c06fd01.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"6.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/goshuushou-sama-ninomiya-kun"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Harem","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Harem"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Ecchi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Ecchi"}]},{"id":"kitsu:4649","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Ginga Tetsudou 999: Glass no Clair","aliases":["Galaxy Express 999: Claire of the Glass","Ginga Tetsudou 999: Glass no Clair","Galaxy Express 999: Glass no Clair","Ginga Tetsudo 999: Glass no Clair"],"description":"This short movie is a remake of the first half of episode 3 of Ginga Tetsudou 999.","releaseInfo":"1980","runtime":"15 min","imdbRating":"6.8","genres":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Space"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/4649/medium.jpg","background":null,"trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"6.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/ginga-tetsudou-999-glass-no-clair"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Space","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Space"}]},{"id":"kitsu:882","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Dual Parallel!

Their biggest case, however, could prove to be finding out why someone wants Kurokawa assassinated. \n(Source: ANN) ","releaseInfo":"2004","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"6.6","genres":["Comedy","Sci-Fi","Mystery","Action","Adventure"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79446/hdtvlogo/mezzo-dsa-5da3ca2d5edf5.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/198/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/79446/showbackground/mezzo-dsa-641b8e14512aa.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"6.6","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/mezzo-dsa"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"},{"name":"Mystery","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mystery"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"}]},{"id":"kitsu:2249","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"School Days","aliases":["School Days"],"description":"High school student Makoto Itou first notices Kotonoha Katsura at the start of his second semester, freshman year. Immediately, he becomes entranced by her beauty, but his bashfulness doesn't allow him to approach her, even though they ride the same train every day. Instead, he snaps a photo of her in secret and sets it as his cell phone's wallpaper: a charm that, if kept under wraps, would supposedly help you realize your love. However, classmate Sekai Saionji spots the picture, but instead of ratting him out, she offers to help set him up with Kotonoha—going so far as befriending her just for him. Thus, the trio begins a rather impromptu friendship. School Days follows the lives of these three teenagers as they traverse the joys and hardships that come with being a high schooler. In a story alive and brimming with romance and melancholy, the tale of these three students will linger in memory long after the momentous conclusion. \n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2007","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"5.5","genres":["School","Harem","Drama","Romance"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/80478/hdtvlogo/school-days-56f1ecd2bc61b.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/2249/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/80478/showbackground/school-days-637c5c9a01f9f.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"5.5","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/school-days"},{"name":"School","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=School"},{"name":"Harem","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Harem"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"}]},{"id":"kitsu:4339","type":"movie","animeType":"movie","name":"Tenjouhen: Utsunomiko","aliases":["Tenjouhen: Utsunomiko","Utsu no Miko","Heavens Compilation: Space Prince"],"description":"Prequel of Utsunomiko.","releaseInfo":"1990","runtime":"71 min","genres":["Adventure","Demons","Fantasy"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.app/anime/poster_images/4339/medium.jpg","background":null,"trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Demons","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Demons"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"}]},{"id":"kitsu:7727","kitsu_id":"7727","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Kurogane no Linebarrels","aliases":["Linebarrels of Iron","Kurogane no Linebarrels"],"description":"Fourteen-year-old Kouichi Hayase’s life has always been a mediocre one, if not dismal.

They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward loses his left leg, Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called \"automail\" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist.\n\nThree years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher's Stone, but their country's murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2009-2010","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.3","genres":["Action","Adventure","Drama","Fantasy","Magic","Military","Comedy"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/85249/hdtvlogo/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood-51e2acc9b4536.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3936/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/85249/showbackground/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood-5ea09a0907f31.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"yb2R1l0O9Zs","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Magic","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Magic"},{"name":"Military","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Military"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"}]},{"id":"kitsu:3505","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Clannad: After Story","aliases":["Clannad ~After Story~","Clannad: After Story"],"description":"Clannad: After Story, the sequel to the critically acclaimed slice-of-life series Clannad, begins after Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa graduate from high school.

Merging these events together are the kindhearted would-be thieves, Isaac and Miria, connecting various people, all of them with their own hidden ambitions and agendas, and creating lifelong bonds and consequences for everyone involved.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite] ","releaseInfo":"2007","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Action","Supernatural","Mystery","Comedy","Historical"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/80421/hdtvlogo/baccano-5ce761fd2c8bb.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/2039/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/80421/showbackground/baccano-629497ec7998f.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"W5bn87yvh_g","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/baccano"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Mystery","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mystery"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"}]},{"id":"kitsu:1376","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Death Note","aliases":["Death Note","DN"],"description":"A shinigami, as a god of death, can kill any person—provided they see their victim's face and write their victim's name in a notebook called a Death Note.

As their friendship deepens, the two attempt to support each other through thick and thin, their deeply intertwined lives filled with romance, music, challenges, and heartbreaks that will ultimately test their seemingly unbreakable bond.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2006-2007","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":["Comedy","Drama","Music","Romance","Slice of Life","Tragedy","Mature"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/80742/hdtvlogo/nana-53ecdd08dc99c.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/777/poster_image/medium-838bd2659fa6198a6626d175be3e967b.jpeg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/80742/showbackground/nana-57de2760507ad.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"NtXI90cMN10","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/nana"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Music","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Music"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"},{"name":"Tragedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Tragedy"},{"name":"Mature","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Mature"}]},{"id":"kitsu:3632","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Nodame Cantabile: Paris-hen","aliases":["Nodame Cantabile: Paris-hen","Nodame Cantabile Paris Chapter","Nodame Cantabile Pari-hen"],"description":"Having been given the opportunity to study in Paris, Noda accompanies Chiaki to Europe as he strives to become the accomplished conductor he always dreamt to be.\n(Source: ANN)","releaseInfo":"2008","runtime":"23 min","imdbRating":"8.0","genres":["Comedy","Music","Romance","Slice of Life"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/80005/hdtvlogo/nodame-cantabile-2007-5cedf139c12fd.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3632/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/80005/showbackground/nodame-cantabile-2007-56ccc69411366.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"8.0","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/nodame-cantabile-paris-chapter"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Music","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Music"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"},{"name":"Slice of Life","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Slice of Life"}]},{"id":"kitsu:2035","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Mononoke","aliases":["Mononoke"],"description":"The \"Medicine Seller\" is a deadly and mysterious master of the occult who travels across feudal Japan in search of malevolent spirits called \"mononoke\" to slay.

That couldn't be further from the truth for Shuurei Kou. Despite the Kou family being an old and important bloodline, they've fallen on hard times. Shuurei's father works as an archivist in the Imperial library, which is a prestigious position, but unfortunately not one that pays much. To put food on the table, Shuurei works odd jobs such as teaching young children or playing live music in a restaurant―and even then, it's barely enough.\nThen, one day, a court advisor makes Shuurei an offer. If she becomes the concubine of the new, but lazy, emperor and teaches him how to become a good ruler, then she will receive 500 pieces of gold. Never one to turn down good money, Shuurei accepts the proposition. After all, the new emperor only prefers men so her virtue is safe… or so she thinks. \nThe more time she spends in the palace, the more her old dream of becoming a court official is reignited. There's only one problem: she's a woman and women do not become government officials. Shuurei may be able to turn the emperor into a good ruler, but will it be at the expense of her own aspirations?","releaseInfo":"2006-2007","runtime":"25 min","imdbRating":"7.8","genres":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama","Fantasy","Historical","Romance"],"poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/847/medium.jpg","background":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/847/original.jpg","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"7.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/saiunkoku-monogatari"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Romance","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Romance"}]},{"id":"kitsu:1824","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Darker than Black","aliases":["Darker than Black","Darker than Black: Kuro no Keiyakusha","DTB"],"description":"It has been 10 years since Heaven's Gate appeared in South America and Hell's Gate appeared in Japan, veiling the once familiar night sky with an oppressive skyscape.

However, when they take on a high-rated delivery to bring an orphan girl named Alvis Hamilton to the battleship Silvana, they get dragged into a much greater conflict that pits them against the might of the Guild.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2003","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.8","genres":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/72902/hdtvlogo/last-exile-543202d16854f.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/76/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/72902/showbackground/last-exile-6213b20935204.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"sG95d8TQomA","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.8","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/last-exile"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"}]},{"id":"kitsu:2871","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei","aliases":["Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei","Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei 2","Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei 2nd Season","Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei Dai Ni Ki","So Long Mr. Despair 2nd","ZSZS"],"description":"More crazy antics abound as Nozomu Itoshiki (a.k.a Zetsubou-sensei), who is the worlds most negative person, tries to teach class 2-F about how life is filled with despair and darkness.

(Hashire, Melos!), Natsume Soseki’s Kokoro, Ryunosuke Akutagawa’s Hell Screen (Jigoku Hen) &amp; The Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito), and Ango Sakaguchi's In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita).\n\nNo Longer Human (Ningen Shikkaku) - A high school student becomes lost and alienated. Despondent and aimless, he falls into a cycle of self abuse, depression and drugs that taints his life for years. Told in four chapters, each chapter deals with a different point in his life and the final chapter leaves him standing alone - an empty and hollow caricature of his former self.\n\nIn the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita) - A love story between a 12th-century woman and a mountain bandit who abducts her.\n\nKokoro - A 1914 tale of a young man's life journey during the Meiji era. The work deals with the transition from the Japanese Meiji society to the modern era, by exploring the friendship between a young man and an older man he calls \"Sensei\". It continues the theme of isolation developed in Soseki's previous works, here in the context of interwoven strands of egoism and guilt, as opposed to shame.\n\nRun, Melos! (Hashire, Melos!) - An updated retelling of a classic Greek tale of the story of Damon and Pythias. The most prominent theme of \"Run, Melos!\" is unwavering friendship. Despite facing hardships, the protagonist Melos does his best to save his friend's life, and in the end his efforts are rewarded.\n\nThe Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito) - The Buddha Shakyamuni chances to notice a cold-hearted criminal suffering in Hell. But this criminal did perform one single act of kindness in not stepping on a spider in a forest. Moved by this selfless act, Shakyamuni takes the silvery thread of a spider in Paradise and lowers it down into Hell, but it falls upon the criminal to seize the opportunity and pull himself out - if he can.\n\nHell Screen (Jigoku Hen) - A famous artist is commissioned by a great lord to create a series of paintings depicting scenes of the \"Buddhist Hell.\" The artist is unable to paint scenes that he has not seen himself, prompting him to torture and torment the Lord's staff to create his imagined images of hell. His creative efforts taint the household, as the story descends into madness and destruction.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","releaseInfo":"2009","runtime":"22 min","imdbRating":"7.6","genres":["Drama","Historical","Psychological","Thriller"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/119781/hdtvlogo/aoi-bungaku-51785d48c6241.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/4900/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/119781/showbackground/aoi-bungaku-5f838857ec9bb.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"sLPeStRHsDU","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.6","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/aoi-bungaku-series"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"},{"name":"Psychological","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Psychological"},{"name":"Thriller","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Thriller"}]},{"id":"kitsu:3514","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Hayate no Gotoku!!","aliases":["Hayate the Combat Butler!!","Hayate no Gotoku!!","Hayate the Combat Butler Season 2"],"description":"Hayate Ayasaki's misfortune continues to hand him the short end of the stick.

Fifty years have passed since mankind developed the Network society. It was anticipated that this new infrastructure would realize a utopia where people connected with each other at the level of consciousness. However, new social problems such as personal data leaks and proliferation of manipulated information began to surface. Nevertheless, people still relied on the Network to exchange information, and proved unable to opt to abandon it.\nIn due course, a new Network realm with more effective security measures was developed. This was called Meta Real Network, usually abbreviated as \"the Metal.\"\nThe Metal accommodated personal memory data within protected virtual stand-alone organic cyber enclaves called bubble shells and eventually pervaded the everyday lives of people.\nHowever, people gradually learned to release and explode their instincts within the secure environment of the Metal. The unleashed instincts pushed each individual's consciousness to drown in the sea of information and to be exposed to the pressures of desire. Meanwhile, norms and regulations continued to bind their real world lives. Thus, strange friction between the two worlds began to manifest themselves as aberrations beyond the bounds of the imaginable.\nExperts who challenged the deep sea of the Metal to investigate and decipher such aberrations were called cyber divers.\nThis is a story of a cyber diver, Masamichi Haru, who investigates the incidents that lie between Reality and the Metal.\n(Source: Production I.G)","releaseInfo":"2008","runtime":"22 min","imdbRating":"6.9","genres":["Action","Sci-Fi"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/81907/hdtvlogo/real-drive-5c9c76a8e55d2.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/2958/medium.jpg","background":"https://images.metahub.space/background/medium/tt1213889/img","trailers":[],"links":[{"name":"6.9","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/rd-sennou-chousashitsu"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Sci-Fi","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Sci-Fi"}]},{"id":"kitsu:1675","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight!","aliases":["Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight!","Manabi Straight!"],"description":"Manabi Straight! follows the lives of a group of young high school girls living in the year 2035 while they attend the all-girl Seioh Private High School.

As the two work to unravel the mystery behind Ciel's chain of misfortunes, a bond forms between them that neither heaven nor hell can tear apart.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2008-2009","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"7.7","genres":["Action","Comedy","Demons","Fantasy","Supernatural","Historical"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/83996/hdtvlogo/kuroshitsuji-5cde11f29ed28.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3840/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/83996/showbackground/kuroshitsuji-60b0f5bb1cfa2.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"S8j5iEklHyI","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"7.7","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/black-butler"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Demons","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Demons"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Supernatural","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Supernatural"},{"name":"Historical","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Historical"}]},{"id":"kitsu:1015","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Tenchi Muyou!

Unlike her vampire family, ever since she was a child, Karin has suffered from polycythemia: a rare disorder which causes her to periodically produce excessive amounts of blood.

As the technology evolves to include robotic enhancements to the human body, the blurring of the line between man and machine triggers a sudden shift in world opinion. In response, the U.N. passes a unilateral ban of further research and development on robotics in 2067. Japan fiercely objects to this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage.

Alien invaders known as the Neuroi came to Earth in 1939. This is not the first appearance of the Neuroi as they have appeared at seemingly random intervals throughout human history. While the Neuroi primarily attack humanity using aircrafts, their mothership is able to produce a deadly miasma, a chemical that is fatally poisonous to humans, forcing the populations of affected areas to flee their homes. The Neuroi then use the poisoned areas to plunder Earth's natural resources to use against humanity. Luckily the miasma cannot spread across water, making the ocean humanity's main line of defense against the Neuroi.\nWith normal humans unable to fight in the miasma, witches have become the forefront of military defense against the Neuroi. Each witch is able to deploy a defensive field around themselves that not only blocks the miasma but protects them from physical attacks as well. Utilizing leg mounted machines called Striker Units to fly into combat, the witches use their magical abilities to wield devastating weapons too large and ungainly for a normal person. The series follows the battles fought by the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, who battle on the front lines to defend the British Isles from the Neuroi.

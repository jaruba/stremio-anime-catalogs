Roger was known as the \"Pirate King,\" the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and death of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King.\nEnter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy’s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"1999-","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.3","genres":["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Fantasy","Super Power","Drama","Friendship"],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/81797/hdtvlogo/one-piece-50634857c8263.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/12/medium.jpg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/81797/showbackground/one-piece-55225fb102498.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"CmTeYj2FmRc","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.3","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/one-piece"},{"name":"Action","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Action"},{"name":"Adventure","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Adventure"},{"name":"Comedy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Comedy"},{"name":"Fantasy","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Fantasy"},{"name":"Super Power","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Super Power"},{"name":"Drama","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Drama"},{"name":"Friendship","category":"Genres","url":"stremio:///discover/https%3A%2F%2Fanime-kitsu.strem.fun%2Fmanifest.json/anime/kitsu-anime-popular?genre=Friendship"}]},{"id":"kitsu:44529","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Overlord IV","aliases":["Overlord IV","Overlord 4"],"description":"The fourth season of Overlord.","releaseInfo":"2022-","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/294002/hdtvlogo/overlord-6096a46d9f516.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/44529/poster_image/medium-47fc61c980133f9026bedd0ea794b406.jpeg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/294002/showbackground/overlord-622f374c3ab85.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"tNYQjEyTO6s","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/overlord-iv"}]},{"id":"kitsu:42951","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Made in Abyss: Retsujitsu no Ougonkyou","aliases":["Made in Abyss: The Golden City of the Scorching Sun","Made in Abyss: Retsujitsu no Ougonkyou","Made in Abyss Season 2"],"description":"The second season of Made in Abyss.\n\nDirectly after the events of Made in Abyss: Fukaki Tamashii no Reimei, the third installment of Made in Abyss covers the adventures of Reg, Riko, and Nanachi in the Sixth Layer, The Capital of the Unreturned.","releaseInfo":"2022-","runtime":"24 min","imdbRating":"8.2","genres":[],"logo":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/326109/hdtvlogo/made-in-abyss-5d00fab53ceec.png","poster":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/42951/poster_image/medium-05f3611e2101cf9e9987e6054c1c836c.jpeg","background":"https://assets.fanart.tv/fanart/tv/326109/showbackground/made-in-abyss-5f6a737dae80c.jpg","trailers":[{"source":"lsDt6xQQxYY","type":"Trailer"}],"links":[{"name":"8.2","category":"imdb","url":"https://kitsu.io/anime/made-in-abyss-retsujitsu-no-ougonkyou"}]},{"id":"kitsu:44032","type":"series","animeType":"TV","name":"Summer Time Rendering","aliases":["Summer Time Rendering","Summertime Render"],"description":"A sci-fi, summer story filled with suspense set on a small island with Shinpei Aijiro, whose childhood friend Ushio Kofune died.
